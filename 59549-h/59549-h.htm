<br />
THE APPEARANCE OF MAN: <i>A PLAY OUT OF
TIME &amp; SPACE</i>.</h2></div>


<p><i>When the curtain rises, two men and a woman are discovered
talking before an illimitable background.</i></p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN</small> [<i>shaking hands with the man and the woman</i>]
Well! Who&#8217;d have thought of meeting you here!</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> Or you, as far as that goes. We thought you
were living in Putney.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> So I am. It just happened that I&#8217;d run over
this morning.</p>

<p>[<i>Enter R. a nebula, spinning slowly. It passes majestically
across the background as the scene proceeds.</i>]</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN.</small> The world&#8217;s a very small place.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> Ah! You&#8217;re right, it is.</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> And how&#8217;s the family?</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> Capital, thanks. Yours well, too, I hope?</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> All except Johnnie.</p>

<p>[<i>Enter R. a group of prehistoric animals; a few brontosauri,
titanotheres, mammoths, sabre-toothed tigers, and so on.</i>]</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> What&#8217;s wrong with him?</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> He was bit by a dog. Nasty place he&#8217;s got.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> Did you have it cauterised? They&#8217;re nasty
things, dog-bites.</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> Oh, yes, we had it cauterised, you may be sure.</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN</small> [<i>reflectively</i>] Dangerous things, dogs.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> If they&#8217;re not properly looked after, they are.
Now I&#8217;ve got a little dog....</p>

<p>[<i>At this point the speaker&#8217;s voice becomes inaudible owing to
the passing of the brontosauri, which gradually move off L.</i>]</p>

<p><small>WOMAN</small> [<i>becoming audible and apparently interrupting in the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<i>middle of an anecdote</i>] Though I tell Johnnie it&#8217;s his own fault.
He shouldn&#8217;t have teased him.</p>

<p>[<i>Enter R. a few thousand savages with flat weapons.</i>]</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN.</small> Boys will be boys.</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> Which is no reason, I say, that they shouldn&#8217;t
learn to behave themselves.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> Can&#8217;t begin too soon, in my opinion.</p>

<p>[<i>Exeunt savages: enter the population of India.</i>]</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> He might have been killed if a man hadn&#8217;t come
up and pulled the dog off him. A black man, he was, too.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> What? A nigger?</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> Or a Turk, or something. I can&#8217;t never see the
difference. [<i>With a shiver.</i>] Ugh! I hate black men, somehow.
The look of &#8217;em gives me the shudders.</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN</small> [<i>on a note of faint expostulation</i>] My dear!</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> I&#8217;ve heard others say the same thing.</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> A pretty penny, Johnnie&#8217;ll cost us, with the
Doctor and all.</p>

<p>[<i>Enter two armies engaged in a Civil War.</i>]</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN</small> [<i>shaking his head, wisely</i>] Ah! I daresay it will.</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN.</small> <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re coming to, what
with wages and prices and Lord knows what all?</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> No more do I. Why, only yesterday....</p>

<p>[<i>The rest of his sentence is drowned by the firing of a battery of
heavy guns.</i>]</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> Oh! well, I suppose it&#8217;ll all come right in time.</p>

<p>[<i>The Civil War moves off L. Signs of the approaching end
of the world become manifest.</i>]</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> We&#8217;ll hope for the best, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

<p>[<i>The Hosts of Heaven appear in the sky.</i>]</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN</small> [<i>reflectively</i>] On the whole, I should say
that things looked a bit better than they did.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>[<i>The Sea gives up its Dead.</i>]</p>

<p><small>WOMAN.</small> We shall take Johnnie to Ramsgate, as soon as
his arm&#8217;s well.</p>

<p><small>FIRST MAN.</small> We always go to Scarborough.</p>

<p><small>SECOND MAN.</small> We have to consider the expense of the
journey, especially now there&#8217;s no cheap trains.</p>

<p>[<i>The universe bursts into flame. For a moment all is confusion;
and then the Spirit of the First Man is heard speaking.</i>]</p>

<p><small>SPIRIT OF FIRST MAN.</small> Well, I suppose I ought to be getting
along.</p>

<p><small>SPIRIT OF SECOND MAN.</small> Glad to have met you, anyway.</p>

<p><small>SPIRIT OF WOMAN.</small> Funny our running up against you
like this. As you said, the world&#8217;s a very small place. Remember
me to the family. [<i>They go out.</i>]</p>

<p><i>The nebula, still spinning slowly, passes of the stage L.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">SIGNS &amp; WONDERS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; DREAMED this in the dullness of a February day in
London.</p>

<p>I had been pondering the elements that go to the making
of the human entity, and more particularly that new aspect
of the theory of the etheric body which presents it as a visible,
ponderable, tangible, highly organised, but almost incredibly
tenuous, form of matter. From that I slid to the consideration
of the possibility of some essence still more remote from our
conception of the gross material of our objective experience;
and then for a moment I held the idea of the imperceptible
transition from this ultimately dispersing matter to thought or
impulse&mdash;from the various bodies, etheric, astral, mental, causal,
or Buddhistic, to the free and absolute Soul.</p>

<p>I suppose that at this point I fell asleep. I was not aware
of any change of consciousness, but I cannot otherwise explain
the fact that in an instant I was transported from an open place
in the North of London, and from all this familiar earth of
ours, to some planet without the knowledge of the dwellers in
the solar system.</p>

<p>This amazing change was accomplished without the least
shock. It was, indeed, imperceptible. The new world upon
which I opened my eyes appeared at first sight to differ in no
particular from that I had so recently left. I saw below me a
perfect replica of the Hampstead Garden Suburb. The wind
blew from the east with no loss of its characteristic quality.
The occasional people who passed had the same air of tired
foreboding and intense preoccupation with the miserable importance
of their instant lives, that has seemed to me to mark
the air of the middle-classes for the past few weeks. Also it
was, I thought, beginning to rain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>I shivered and decided that I might as well go home. I felt
that it was not worth while to travel a distance unrecordable
in any measure of earthly miles, only to renew my terrestrial
experiences. And then, by an accident, possibly to verify my
theory that it was certainly going to rain, I looked up and realised
at once the unspeakable difference between that world and
our own.</p>

<p>For on this little earth of ours the sky makes no claim on
our attention. It has its effects of cloud and light occasionally,
and these effects no doubt may engage at times the interest of
the poet or the artist. But to us, ordinary people, the sky is
always pretty much the same, and we only look at it when we
are expecting rain. Even then we often shut our eyes.</p>

<p>In that other world which revolves round a sun so distant
that the light of it has not yet reached the earth the sky is quite
different. Things happen in it. As I looked up, for instance, I
saw a great door open, and out of it there marched an immense
procession that trailed its glorious length across the whole width
of heaven. I heard no sound. The eternal host moved in silent
dignity from zenith to horizon. And after the procession had
passed the whole visible arch of the sky was parted like a curtain
and there looked out from the opening the semblance of a
vast, intent eye.</p>

<p>But what immediately followed the gaze of that overwhelming
watcher I do not know, for someone touched my
arm, and a voice close at my shoulder said in the very tones of
an earthly cockney:</p>

<p>&#8220;What yer starin&#8217; at, guv&#8217;nor? Airyplanes? I can&#8217;t see
none.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him and found that he was just such a loafer as
one may see any day in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aeroplanes,&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;Great Heaven, can&#8217;t you see
what&#8217;s up there? The procession and that eye?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared up then, and I with him, and the eye had gone; but
between the still parted heavens I could see into the profundity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of a space so rich with beauty and, as it seemed, with promise,
that I held my breath in sheer wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I can&#8217;t see nothin&#8217;, guv&#8217;nor,&#8221; my companion said.</p>

<p>And I presume that as he spoke I must have waked from
my dream, for the glory vanished and I found myself dispensing
a small alms to a shabby man who was representing himself as
most unworthily suffering through no fault of his own.</p>

<p>As I walked home through the rain I reflected that the
people of that incredibly distant world, walking, as they always
do, with their gaze bent upon the ground, are probably unable
to see the signs and wonders that blaze across the sky. They,
like ourselves, are so preoccupied with the miserable importance
of their instant lives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE CAGE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS not asleep. I have watched passengers who kept
their eyes shut between the stations, but as yet I have
not seen an indisputable case of anyone sound asleep on the
Hampstead and Charing Cross Tube. Of the other passages
that make up London&#8217;s greater intestine I have less experience,
and it may be that some tubes are more conducive to slumber
than the one most familiar to me. I have no ambition to make
a dogmatic generalisation concerning either the stimulative or
soporific action of the Underground. I merely wish it to be
understood that I was not asleep, and that it was hardly possible
that I could have been, with a small portmanteau permanently
on one foot, and the owner of it&mdash;a little man who must have
wished that the straps were rather longer&mdash;intermittently on
the other. Against this, however, I have to put the fact that I
could not say at which station the little man removed from me
the burden of himself and his portmanteau. Nor could I give
particulars of the appearance of such of my innumerable fellow-passengers
as were most nearly presented to me, although I do
know that most of them were reading&mdash;even the strap-hangers.
It was, indeed, this observation that started my vision or train
of thought or preoccupation&mdash;call it anything you like except
a dream.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The eyes in his otherwise repulsive face held a wistfulness,
a hint of vague speculation that attracted me. He sat, hunched
on the summit of the steeply rising ground overlooking the
sea, the place where the forest comes so abruptly to an end that
from a little distance it looks as if it had been gigantically planed
to a hard edge.</p>

<p>He was alone and ruminatively quiescent after food. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had fed well and carelessly. Some of the bones that lay near
him had been very indifferently picked. He leaned forward
clasping his hairy legs with his equally hairy arms, and stared
out with that hint of speculation and wistfulness in his eyes
over the placid magnificence of the Western Sea&mdash;just disturbed
enough to reflect a gorgeous road of fire that laid a
vanishing track across the waters up to the open goal of the
low sun. A faint breeze blew up the hill, and it seemed as if
he leant his face forward to drink the first refreshment of that
sweet, cool air.</p>

<p>I approached him more nearly, trying to read his thought,
rejoicing in the knowledge that he could neither see nor apprehend
me. For though a man may know something of the past,
the future is hidden from him, and I represented to him a future
that could only be reckoned in a vast procession of centuries.
Yet as I came nearer, so near that I could rest my hands on his
knees and gaze up closely into his eyes, he shrank a little and
leaned slightly away from me, as if he were uncertainly aware
of an unfamiliar, distasteful presence. I fancied that the mat
of hair on his chest just perceptibly bristled.</p>

<p>I could read his thought, now, and I was thrilled to discover
that the expression of his eyes had not misled me. He had attained
to a form of consciousness. He, alone, of all the beasts
had received the gift of constructive imagination. He could
look forward, make plans to meet a possible emergency. He
knew already something of tomorrow. Even then he was deep
in speculation. That day he had hunted a slow but cunning
little beast which found a refuge among the great boulders that
lay piled in gigantic profusion along the foreshore. And he
had failed. Another quarry had been his, but that particular
little beast had outwitted him. And now, longing for it, he
ruminated clumsy lethargic plans for its capture.</p>

<p>It may have been that the unusual effort tired him, for
presently he slept, still hunched into the same compact heap,
crouching with an effect of swift alertness as if he were ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at the least alarm to leap up and vanish into the cover of the
forest.</p>

<p>Then, a plan came to me, also. I would bring a vision to
this primitive ancestor of mankind. I would merge myself with
his being and he should dream a dream of the immensely distant
future. Blessed and privileged above all the human race,
he should know for an instant to what inconceivable developments,
to what towering heights of intellectual and manipulative
glory his descendants should one day be heir. I had no
definite idea of the precise illustration I should choose to set
forth the magnificence of man&#8217;s latest attainment. Nor did I
pause to consider what I myself might suffer in the process of
this infamous liaison between the ages. I acted on an impulse
that I found irresistible. I have myself longed so often to read
the distant future of mankind, that I felt as a god bestowing an
inestimable gift. But I should have known that in the mystical
union it is the god and not the man who suffers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was wrapped in an awful darkness as we fell stupendously
through time, but presently I knew that we were rising again,
weighted with the burden of primitive flesh. Then in an instant
came a strange yellow unnatural light, the roaring of a terrible
sound&mdash;and the fearful vision. The horror of it was unendurable;
the shock of it so great that spirit and flesh were rent
asunder. I remained. He fell back to the sweetness of the cool
air blowing up from the tranquil sea.</p>

<p>Did he rush frantically into the forest or sit with dripping
mouth and wide alarmed eyes, rigidly staring at the scarlet rim
of the setting sun? Yet what could he have understood of the
future in that moment of detestable revelation? Could he have
recognised men and women in their strange disguise of modern
dress, as being even of the same species as himself? And if he
had, what could he have known of them, seeing them packed
so closely together, immoveably wedged into the terror of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
rocking roaring cage of unknown material; seeing them occupied
in staring so intently and incomprehensibly at those amazing
little black-dotted white sheets? Impossible for him to guess
that those speckled sheets held a magic that transported his
descendants from the misery of their cage into imaginations
so extensive and so various that some of them might, however
dimly and allusively, include himself, hunched and ruminant,
regarding the vast tranquillity of the sea.</p>

<p>The tunnel suddenly broke, the roaring gave place to a
rattle that by contrast was gentle and soothing. I opened my
eyes. We were under the sky again, slipping, with intermittent
flashes of light, into the harbour of Golder&#8217;s Green Station.</p>

<p>For a moment, I seemed to see the clumsy and violent
shape of a beast that strove in panic to escape; and then I came
back to my own world of the patient readers, with their white,
controlled faces, forming now in solemn procession down the
aisle of the carriage.</p>

<p>But it was his dream, not mine. And I have been wondering
whether, if I dreamed also, the distant future might not
seem equally unendurable to me?</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">ENLARGEMENT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN he heard the first signal, warning the people of
London to take cover, his spirit revolted.</p>

<p>He began to picture with a sick disgust the scene of his
coming confinement in the dirty basement. Mrs. Gibson, his
landlady, would welcome him with the air of forced cheerfulness
he knew so well. She would make the same remarks
about the noise of the guns. She would say again: &#8220;Well,
there&#8217;s one thing, it drowns the noise of the bombs&mdash;if they&#8217;ve
really got here this time.&#8221; Then Maunders from the first floor
would say that you could always pick out the sound of the aerial
torpedoes; and explain, elaborately, why. Mrs. Graham from
the second floor would say that she&#8217;d rather enjoy it, if it weren&#8217;t
for the children. And her eldest little prig of a boy would say,
&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid, mumma,&#8221; and expect everyone to praise his
courage. Mrs. Gibson would praise him, of course. She would
say: &#8220;There, now, I declare he&#8217;s the bravest of anyone.&#8221; She
was obliged to do it. She would never be able to get new
lodgers this winter. And when that preliminary talk was done
with, they would all begin again on the endlessly tedious topic
of reprisals; and keep it up until a pause in the barrage set them
on to spasmodic ejaculations of wonder whether &#8220;they&#8221; had
been driven off, or gone, or been shot down, or....</p>

<p>No; definitely, he would not stand it. He could better
endure the simultaneous explosion of every gun in London
than three hours of that conversation. Moreover, he could
not face the horrible drip, drip, from the scullery sink. On the
night of the last raid he had been very near the sink. And the
thought of that steady plop ... plop ... of water into the
galley-pot Mrs. Gibson kept under the tap for some idiotic
reason, was as the thought of an inferno such as could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
been conceived by Dante, nor organised by the Higher German
Command.</p>

<p>Nerves? He shrugged his shoulders. In a sense, no doubt.
Suspense, dread, a long exasperation of waiting had filled every
commonplace experience&mdash;more particularly that dreadful
dripping of the cold water tap&mdash;with all kinds of horrible associations.
But if it was &#8220;nerves,&#8221; it was not nervousness, not
fear of being killed, nothing in the least like panic. He was
quite willing to face the possible danger of the open streets.
But he could not and would not face Mrs. Gibson and the
scullery sink.</p>

<p>No; he must escape&mdash;a fugitive from protection. Men
had fled from strange things, but had they ever fled from a
stranger thing than refuge? He must go secretly. If Mrs. Gibson
heard him she would stop him, begin an immense, unendurable
argument. She could not afford to risk the loss of a
lodger this winter. She would bring Maunders and Mrs.
Graham to join her in persuasion and protest. Freedom was
hard to win in London, in such times as these.</p>

<p>He crept down the long three flights of stairs like some
wary criminal feeling his cautious way to liberty. But once he
had, with infinite deliberation, slipped back the ailing latch of
the front door, he lifted his head and squared his shoulders with
a great gasp of relief. He could have wept tears of exultation.
He was filled with a deep thankfulness for this boon of his enlargement....</p>

<p>There was no sound of guns as yet; nor any sweep of
searchlights tormenting the wide gloom of the sky. It was a
wonderful, calm night; a little misty on the ground; but, above,
the moon was serene and bright as a new guinea.</p>

<p>He had no hesitation as to his direction. He desired the
greatest possible expansion of outlook; and turned his face at
once towards the river. On the Embankment he would be
able to see a wide arc of the sky. He had a sense of setting
about a prohibited adventure, full of the most daring and delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
excitements. His one dread was that he might be interfered
with, stopped, sent home.</p>

<p>The cycling policemen looked at him, he thought, with
peculiar suspicion. They gruffly shouted at him to take cover,
with a curt note of warning, as if he were breaking the law by
indulging himself in this escapade. He tried to avoid notice
by slinking into the shadows. That cold, inimical moonlight
made everything so conspicuous....</p>

<p>Except for the policemen, the streets were vividly empty.
He could feel the spirit of London crouched in expectancy.
Behind every darkened window men, women, and children
waited and longed for the relief of the first gun. And while
they waited they chattered and smiled. And all their laughter
and conversation was like these streets, vividly empty; their
spirits had taken cover.</p>

<p>He alone was free, exempt, rejoicing in his liberty....</p>

<p>The ground mist was thicker on the Embankment; and
for a moment he was confused by the loom of a strange obelisk
that had a curiously remote, exotic air in the midst of this familiar
London. Then he recognised the outline as that of Cleopatra&#8217;s
Needle, and went close up to the alien monument of
another age and stared up at it in the proclamatory moonlight.
He wondered if any magic lingered in those cryptic inscriptions?
If they might not have endowed the very granite with
curious, occult powers. He was still staring at the solemn
portent of the obelisk when the barrage opened with unusual
suddenness....</p>

<p>For a time he was crushed and overwhelmed by the pressure
of that intimidating fury of sound. He cowered and winced
like a naked soul exposed to the intimate vengeance of God.
He was as beaten and battered by the personal threat of those
cumulative explosions as if every gun sought him and him alone
as the objective of its awful wrath.</p>

<p>But, by degrees, he began to grow accustomed even to that
world-rocking pandemonium. He became aware of the undertones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that laced the dominant roar and thunder of artillery.
He could trace, he believed, beside the shriek of shell, the
humming whirr of an aeroplane he could not see. And once
something whizzed past him with a high singing hiss that
ended abruptly with a sharp clip. He guessed that a fragment
of shrapnel had buried itself in one of the plane-trees.</p>

<p>Yet the real danger of that warning did not terrify him as
had the enormous onslaught of noise from the barrage. At the
next intermission of the deafening bombardment he stood up,
rested his hand on the plinth of the obelisk, and stared, wondering
and unafraid, into the great arc of the sky. He could
see no aeroplanes.... The stillness was so profound that he
could hear with a grateful distinctness the soft clucking ripple
of the rising flood.</p>

<p>Presently he dropped his regard for the heavens to the plain
objective of deserted London. The mist had almost dispersed
in some places, had thickened in others&mdash;churned and driven,
perhaps, by the vast pressure of the sound waves. Across the
road he could see the impending cliff of great buildings, pale
and tall in the moonlight. At his feet the plane-trees threw
trembling, skeleton shadows. All the town waited in suspense
to know whether or not the bombardment would presently be
renewed.</p>

<p>He had a presentiment that it was all over. He felt the
quick exaltation and vigour of one who has suffered and escaped
danger. But when he looked up the Embankment and saw
what he took to be the silhouettes of three towering trams
emerging with furtive silence from the mist, he was aware of
a faint sense of disappointment. Nothing was left to him but
to return to the common dreariness of life.</p>

<p>He took a step towards the trams that were advancing with
such a stately, such a hushed and ponderous deliberation....</p>

<p>Trams...?</p>

<p>He held his breath, staring and gaping, and then backed
nervously against the pedestal of the great Egyptian monument.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>Had the shock of that awful bombardment broken his
nerve? Was he mad? Bewitched by some ancient magic? Or
was it, perhaps, that in one swift inappreciable moment he had
been instantly killed by a fragment of shrapnel, and that, now,
his emerging spirit could, even as it watched these familiar
surroundings, peer back deep into the hidden mysteries of time?</p>

<p>He pressed himself, shivering and fascinated, against the
hard, insistent reality of cold granite; but still in single file
these three colossal shapes advanced, solemn and majestic, rocking
magnificently with a slow and powerful gravity.</p>

<p>They were almost abreast of him now, sombre and stolid&mdash;three
vast, prehistoric, unattended Elephants, imperturbably
exploring the silences of this dead and lonely city.</p>

<p>They passed, and left him weak and trembling, but indescribably
happy.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, a blind and insensible policeman, following
the very path of those magical evocations of the thought
of ancient Egypt, rode carelessly by, bearing the banal message
that all was clear.</p>

<p>But the adventurer walked home in a dream of ecstasy.
Whatever the future might hold for him, he had pierced the
veil of the commonplace. He had seen and heard on the Thames
Embankment that sacred, mystical procession of the Elephants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He looked at Mrs. Gibson with something of contempt
when she brought him his breakfast next morning. He could
not respond to her chatter concerning the foolish detail of last
night&#8217;s raid. She, poor woman, was afraid that she might, in
some unknown way, have offended him. Her last effort was
meant as an amiable diversion. One never knew whether
people weren&#8217;t more scared than they chose to admit.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one amusin&#8217; bit,&#8221; she said, laying his morning
paper on the table, &#8220;as I just glanced at while I was waitin&#8217;
for the water to boil. It&#8217;s in Hincidents of the Raid. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as three performin&#8217; elephunts goin&#8217; &#8217;ome from the &#8217;Ippodrome
or somewhere got loose&mdash;their keeper done a bolt, I suppose,
when the guns began&mdash;and got walkin&#8217; off by theirselves all
down the Embankment. They must &#8217;a been a comic sight,
poor things. Terrified they was, no doubt....&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, why should God explain his miracles through the
mouth of a Mrs. Gibson?</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE PERFECT SMILE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE REALISATION of it first came to Douglas Owen
when he was not quite five years old.</p>

<p>From his babyhood he had been spoilt, more particularly
by his father. He could be such a charming little boy, and his
frequent outbreaks of real naughtiness were overlooked or
gently reproved. They were even admired in private by his
parents, who regarded these first signs of disobedience, temper,
and selfishness as the marks of an independent and original
spirit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Douglas was nearly five years old, he
achieved a minor climax that the most indulgent father could
not overlook. Despite all warnings and commands, Douglas
would steal from the larder. When there were cakes or tarts
he took those for preference, but when there was nothing else
he would steal bread, merely, as it seemed, for the pleasure of
stealing it. His father had protested to his mother that everything
should be kept under lock and key, but as Mrs. Owen
explained: &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect a cook to be for ever locking
things up.&#8221; And the little Douglas was ingenious in his depredations.
He chose his moment with cunning. Also he knew,
as the cook herself confessed, how &#8220;to get round her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Owen, who was a tender-hearted idealist, admitted
at last that stern measures were called for, and he took Douglas
into his study and remonstrated with him gently, even
lovingly, but with great earnestness. The remonstrance gained
strength from Mrs. Owen&#8217;s fear that Douglas might make
himself seriously ill by his illicit feastings. Douglas, who was
forward for his age, listened with attention to his father&#8217;s serious
lecture and promised reform. &#8220;I won&#8217;t do it again, father.
Promise,&#8221; he said with apparent sincerity. And his father, believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
absolutely in his child&#8217;s truthfulness, and remembering
his wife&#8217;s adjuration to be &#8220;really firm,&#8221; was tempted to clinch
the thing once for all by issuing an ultimatum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t, little son,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because you see
if you did, daddy would have to whack you. He&#8217;d hate doing
it, but he&#8217;d have to do it all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Douglas&#8217;s expression was faintly speculative. He had heard
something like this before, from his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve promised faithfully that you&#8217;ll never, never
take anything out of the larder, or the kitchen, or the pantry
again, haven&#8217;t you, darling?&#8221; Mr. Owen persisted, by way of
having everything quite clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promised faithfully,&#8221; agreed Douglas; parted from his
father with a hug of forgiveness; and was found a quarter of an
hour later in the larder, eating jam with a spoon from a newly-opened
jar.</p>

<p>&#8220;You threatened to whack him if he didn&#8217;t keep his promise,
and you must do it,&#8221; Mrs. Owen said firmly to her husband.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t keep your promises, how can you expect
him to keep his?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; murmured Mr. Owen with great intensity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall bring him in and leave him with you,&#8221; his wife
said, correctly interpreting her husband&#8217;s method of reluctantly
accepting the inevitable.</p>

<p>Douglas was brought, and it was evident that on this occasion
he was truly conscious of sin and apprehensive of the
result. All his nonchalance was gone from him. He did not
cry, but his eyes were wide and terrified. He looked a thoroughly
guilty and scared child.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen hardened his heart. He thought of the contempt
shown for his authority, of the wilfully broken promise,
and of the threat to his son&#8217;s future unless he were made to
realise that sin cannot go unpunished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Owen, looking at her husband&#8217;s stern face, was satisfied
that justice would be done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>And then, when father and son were alone and sentence
had been pronounced, the smile came for the first time.</p>

<p>Douglas did not know why or how it came. He was only
conscious of it as something that illuminated his whole being,
put him among the angels, and gave him immunity from all
earthly terrors.</p>

<p>To his father, the smile was simply blinding. It was so
radiant, so tender, forgiving, and altogether godlike. It condescended
to his weakness and mortality, and made him feel how
unworthy he was of such splendid recognition. His little son&#8217;s
face glowed with a perfect consciousness of power, and yet he
seemed to surrender himself with a dignified humility to this
threatened infamy of corporal punishment. Moreover, it was
a smile that expressed the ultimate degree of innocence. It
was impossible for anyone who saw it to believe that Douglas
could have sinned in perversity, or with any evil intention.</p>

<p>And there was one other amazing peculiarity about this
rare smile of Douglas&#8217;s, for it not only permeated the finer
feelings of those who witnessed it, but was also reflected weakly
in their faces, as the outer and larger rainbow reflects the
intensified beauty of the inner.</p>

<p>So now Mr. Owen&#8217;s smile faintly echoed his son&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Daddy,&#8221; said Douglas confidently.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Owen waiting outside, listening in tremulous
agitation for the wail that should announce her husband&#8217;s resolution,
heard no sound. And presently Douglas came out,
still wearing the last pale evidences of his recent halo.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Mrs. Owen asked her husband,
when their son was out of earshot. She would have overlooked
the essential omission, almost with gratitude, if she had not
believed it her duty to reprove her husband&#8217;s characteristic
weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he smiled,&#8221; Mr. Owen said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Harold!&#8221; his wife protested.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen wrinkled his forehead and looked exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
distressed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can explain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t an ordinary smile. I&#8217;ve never seen him do it before. I&mdash;I
have never seen anything like it. I can only say that I
would defy anyone to punish him when he smiled like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed as he came out....&#8221; began Mrs. Owen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was practically over then,&#8221; her husband interrupted,
and added with a slightly literary turn of speech he sometimes
adopted: &#8220;That was only the afterglow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it is worth recording that, from that time, Douglas,
although he was naughty enough in other ways, never robbed
the larder again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nine years passed before Douglas&#8217;s great gift was once
more manifested.</p>

<p>There was undoubtedly something unusually charming
about the boy that protected him from punishment; and as he
had been spoilt by his father at home, so was he also treated
rather too leniently at school. But Dr. Watson, his headmaster,
came at last to the end of his weakness. Douglas was
becoming a bad influence in the school. His careless evasions
of discipline set an example of insubordination that was all too
readily followed by the other boys.</p>

<p>Dr. Watson braced himself to the inevitable. In his heart
he regretted the necessity, but he knew that Douglas must be
sacrificed for the good of the school. He had been warned and
mildly punished a hundred times. Now he must pay the full
penalty.</p>

<p>The choice lay between expulsion and a public flogging,
and when Douglas chose the latter, Dr. Watson resolved that
the flogging should be of unusual severity. When the whole
school was assembled, he made a very earnest and moving
speech, deploring the causes that had given rise to the occasion,
and showing how inevitable was the disgraceful result.</p>

<p>Douglas, white and terrified, made ready in a trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
silence, then, turning his back on the tensely expectant audience,
he faced his headmaster.</p>

<p>Arthur Coburn, Douglas&#8217;s humanitarian house-master,
was so upset by these preliminaries that for one moment he
was tempted to leave the hall. Corporal punishment had always
seemed to him a horrible thing, but never had it seemed
quite so revolting as on this occasion. Yet he fought against
the feeling. He knew that his chief was neither a stern nor a
cruel man, and had been driven into the present position by
the sheerly impudent persistence of Douglas&#8217;s disobedience.
By way of alleviating as far as possible his own nervous distress,
therefore, Coburn took up a position with his back to the rostrum,
and faced the great crowd of just perceptibly intimidated
boys.</p>

<p>And waiting, much as Douglas&#8217;s mother had waited in
shamed anxiety some nine years before, Coburn was amazed
to see a sudden and incomprehensible change in the massed
faces before him. The tensity, the look of half eager, half apprehensive
expectation strangely relaxed. A wave of what
looked like relief ran back in a long ripple of emotion from the
front to the back of the many ranks of watching boys. In one
instant everyone was wearing a faint smile of almost holy serenity.</p>

<p>Coburn turned with a leap of astonishment and stared at
Dr. Watson. And the smile he saw on the headmaster&#8217;s face
outshone that on the faces of his audience as the sun outshines
the moon.</p>

<p>But no one save Dr. Watson saw the perfect radiance that
flowed out from the face of Douglas Owen....</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sir,&#8221; was all that Douglas said.</p>

<p>Dr. Watson dropped his birch as if it had burnt him.</p>

<p>His second address to the school was hesitating and apologetic.
He tried to explain that when the clear signs of repentance
and of reform were so evident as they were in the case
of Owen, corporal punishment was superfluous and would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
little short of criminal. Yet even Coburn, who so profoundly
agreed with the principle expounded, found the explanation
unsatisfying. He could not help feeling that Dr. Watson was
concealing his true reason.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is well to note that after this reprieve
Douglas passed the remainder of his school-life without committing
any other serious offence.</p>

<p>He was only thirty-two when he came before the last and
most terrible tribunal possible in our society.</p>

<p>After he left Cambridge, he was taken into a city office
by a friend of his father&#8217;s. Everyone liked him, and he might
have made an excellent position for himself if he had not led
such a loose life out of business hours. He seemed unable to
resist any temptation, and the inevitable result was that he got
into debt.</p>

<p>When his father&#8217;s friend discovered the extent of Douglas&#8217;s
thefts from the firm, he had no choice but to dismiss him; although
for the young man&#8217;s sake not less than for the sake of
his friendship with his father, he never even threatened prosecution.</p>

<p>For a time Douglas lived at home. Later he went to Canada
for a couple of years. Then his father died, leaving him
some five or six thousand pounds, and he came home again&mdash;to
spend it. When that money was all gone, he lived on the
charity of his many friends. They all knew him for an incorrigible
scamp, but he still retained much of his old charm.</p>

<p>The crime for which he came at last to be tried for his life
at the Old Bailey was too disgraceful an affair to be reported
in detail. The only possible defence was that Douglas was
unquestionably drunk when the murder was actually committed.
Yet despite the weakness of the case for the defending
counsel, everyone in court including the jury and possibly even
Lord Justice Ducie himself, could not restrain a feeling of sympathy
for the prisoner. He had not lost, despite all his excesses,
his engaging air of ingenuous youth. And his manner throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the trial naturally evoked a strong sense of pity.</p>

<p>The jury did all they could for him by bringing in a verdict
of manslaughter.</p>

<p>The judge leaned forward with a kindly, almost fatherly
air, as he asked the prisoner if he had anything to say in his
own defence.</p>

<p>And at that supreme moment, as he stood white and terrified
in the dock, Douglas was aware that once more, for the
third time in his life, that wonderful glow of power, peace, and
condescension was beginning to thrill through him.</p>

<p>He straightened himself and raised his head. He looked
the judge in the face. He believed that the perfect smile had
come again to save him. But he looked in vain for the old response.</p>

<p>The judge&#8217;s mouth had twitched as Douglas looked at
him, and for one instant all those who were waiting so anxiously
for the pronouncement of the sentence were astounded to
see a look of horrible bestiality flicker across the face of the old
man who was accounted the most gentle and philanthropic
judge who had ever sat in the criminal court. It was only a
momentary impression, for Lord Ducie at once put both hands
before his face as if to shut off the sight of some terrible infamy;
but Bateson, the defending counsel, who was watching the
judge, says that he never afterwards could quite recover his old
respect for him.</p>

<p>It is unquestionably true that the hideous, depraved, and
insulting grimace which had so unexpectedly revealed the soul
of Douglas Owen, was solely responsible for the maximum
sentence of twenty years&#8217; penal servitude that was imposed
upon him.</p>

<p>If a man continually flouts the angels of grace, he must
expect at last to be delivered over to the devil he so devotedly
serves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE HIDDEN BEAST</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HIS HOUSE is the last in the village. Towards the forest
the houses become more and more scattered, reaching
out to the wild of the wood as if they yearned to separate themselves
from the swarm that clusters about the church and the
inn. And his house has taken so long a stride from the others
that it is held to the village by no more than the slender thread
of a long footpath. Yet the house is set with its face towards
us, and has an air of resolutely holding on to the safety of our
common life, as if dismayed at its boldness in swimming so far
it had turned and desperately grasped the life-line of that footpath.</p>

<p>He lived alone, a strange man, surly and reticent. Some
said that he had a sinister look; and on those rare occasions
when he joined us at the inn, after sunset, he sat aside and spoke
little.</p>

<p>I was surprised when, as we came out of the inn one night,
he took my arm and asked me if I would go home with him.
The moon was at the full, and the black shadows of the dispersing
crowd that lunged down the street seemed to gesticulate
an alarm of weird dismay. The village was momentarily
mad with the clatter of footsteps and the noise of laughter, and
somewhere down towards the forest a dog was baying.</p>

<p>I wondered if I had not misunderstood him.</p>

<p>As he watched my hesitation his face pleaded with me.
&#8220;There are times when a man is glad of company,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>We spoke little as we passed through the village towards
the silences of his lonely house. But when we came to the footpath
he stopped and looked back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I live between two worlds,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the wild and ...&#8221;&mdash;he
paused before he rejected the obvious antithesis, and concluded&mdash;&#8220;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
restrained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we so restrained?&#8221; I asked, staring at the huddle of
black-and-silver houses clinging to their refuge on the hill.</p>

<p>He murmured something about a &#8220;compact,&#8221; and my
thoughts turned to the symbol of the chalk-white church-tower
that dominated the honeycomb of the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;The compact of public opinion,&#8221; he said more boldly.</p>

<p>My imagination lagged. I was thinking less of him than
of the transfiguration of the familiar scene before me. I did
not remember ever to have studied it thus under the reflections
of a full moon. An echo of his word, differently accented, drifted
through my mind. I saw our life as being in truth compact,
little and limited.</p>

<p>He took up his theme again when we had entered the house
and were facing each other across the table, in a room that
looked out over the forest. The shutters were unfastened, the
window open, and I could see how, on the further shore of the
waste-lands, the light feebly ebbed and died against the black
cliff of the wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to choose between freedom and safety,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The individual is too wild and dangerous for the common
life. He must make his agreement with the community; submit
to become a member of the people&#8217;s body. But I&#8221;&mdash;he
paused and laughed&mdash;&#8220;<i>I</i> have taken the liberty of looking out
of the back window.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he spoke I had been aware of a sound that seemed
to come from below the floor of the room in which we were
sitting. And when he laughed I fancied that I heard the response
of a snuffling cry.</p>

<p>He looked at me mockingly across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an echo from the jungle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some trick of
reflected sound. I can always hear it in this room at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shivered and stood up. &#8220;I prefer the safety of our common
life,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;It may be that I have a limited mind
and am afraid, but I find my happiness in the joys of security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and shelter. The wild terrifies me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A limited mind?&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Probably it is rather
that you lack a fire in the blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was glad to leave him, and he on his part made no effort
to detain me.</p>

<p>It was not long after this visit of mine that the people first
began to whisper about him in the village. At the beginning
they brought no charge against him, talking only of his strangeness
and of his separation from our common interests. But presently
I heard a story of some fierce wild animal that he caged
and tortured in the prison of his house. One said that he had
heard it screaming in the night, and another that he had heard
it beating against the door. And some argued that it was a
threat to our safety, since the beast might escape and make its
way into the village; and some that such brutality, even though
it were to a wild animal, could not be tolerated. But I wondered
inwardly whether the affair were any business of ours so
long as he kept the beast to himself.</p>

<p>I was a member of the Council that year, and so took part
in the voting when presently the case was laid before us. But
no vote of mine would have helped him if I had dared to overcome
my reluctance and speak in his favour. For whatever
reservations may have been secretly withheld by the members
of the Council, they were unanimous in condemning him.</p>

<p>We went, six of us, in full daylight, to search his house.
He received us with a laugh, and told us that we might seek
at our leisure. But though we sought high and low, peering
and tapping, we found no evidence that any wild thing had
ever been concealed there.</p>

<p>And within a month of the day of our search he left the
village.</p>

<p>I saw him alone once before he went, and he told me that
he had chosen for the wild and freedom, that he could no longer
endure to be held to the village even by the thread of the
footpath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>But he did not thank me for having allowed the search of
his house to be conducted by daylight, although he knew that
I at least was sure no echo of the forest could be heard in that
little room of his save in the transfigured hours between the
dusk and the dawn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE BARRAGE<br />

<i>A STUDY IN EXTROVERSION</i></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY FRIEND has a wonderful voice, a primitive voice,
open-throated and resonant, the great chest roar of the
wild. When he shouts he does it without visible effort. The
full red of his face may deepen to the opening shades of purple,
but that evidence of constriction is due solely to emotion. The
lift of a major third in his tone is accomplished without any appearance
of muscular effort. He opens another cylinder and
lets the additional power find its own pitch in the reverberating
brass of the fog-horn. And the effect is as if the devastating
crash of the barrage had come suddenly and horribly near.
Perhaps, for one instant, the attack of his voice ceases, and
then while the room still trembles to the echo of his last statement,
the barrage leaps forward and spills its explosion into
the secret refuges of my being.</p>

<p>Behind that cover, the sense of the statements he gives
forth with such enormous assurance creeps up and falls upon
me while I am still insensible. It is as though his argument
bayoneted me treacherously while I am paralysed from shock.
If my mind were free I could defeat the simple attack of his
argument; but should I be given one trifling opportunity for
speech I can never take it. My mind is battered, crushed and
inert. I dare not lift my head for fear of exposing myself again
to that awful approach of the barrage.</p>

<p>My friend has described himself so conclusively in a term
of the old free-trade dispute, that nothing could be added to
enlighten his definition. He is, and prides himself vociferously
on the fact, a whole-hogger. He gets that off on his lower register
which is just bearable. There is no need for the barrage
to defend the approach of that statement. It is self-evident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The great welt of his boots, massive as an Egyptian plinth;
the stiff hairiness of his bristling tweeds; the honest amazement
of his ripe face; the very solidity of the signet ring that
is nevertheless not too heavy for his hirsute finger&mdash;all these
proclaim him as the type and consummation of the whole-hogger.</p>

<p>He adopted the label with pride some time in the middle
&#8217;nineties, when he was already a mature, determined and unalterable
man of twenty-eight. He was a fervent patriot
throughout the Boer War. He has, since December, 1905,
spent a fount of energy that would have wrecked the physique
of ten average men in denouncing such things as Education
Bills, Old Age Pensions, the Reform of the House of Lords,
Home Rule&mdash;in brief, the Government&mdash;or, as he always
called it, &#8220;<i>this</i> Government.&#8221; And since the beginning of the
war he has demonstrated&mdash;proving every statement of the
<i>Times</i> by the evidence of the <i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash;that there will
never be any truth or sanity in the world until the whole German
race is beaten to its perjured knees (his metaphors sometimes
have an effect of concentration); until it is so thrashed,
scourged, humiliated, broken and defeated (a barrage is necessarily
redundant) that the last remaining descendants of the
Prussian shall crawl, pitifully exposed and humbled, about the
earth, begging God and man for forgiveness.</p>

<p>My friend is, in fact, the perfect type of what is known
to psycho-analysts as the extrovert. He has never questioned
himself, never doubted the infallibility of his own gospel, never
known fear. He does not understand the meaning of the word
introspection, and feels nothing but pity for a man who halts
between two opinions. He divides all mankind into two categories&mdash;splendid
fellows and damned fools&mdash;although I have
found the suggestion of a third division in his description of a
querulous Tory as &#8220;a damned fool on the right side.&#8221; On the
wrong side, however, there are no splendid fellows. As he
says, he &#8220;hasn&#8217;t patience&#8221; with anyone who is either so thick-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
or so unscrupulous as to disagree with him in politics.</p>

<p>By way of a hobby he farms 800 acres of land, and he has
never had any trouble with his labourers. I will admit that he
is generous with a careless, exuberant generosity that does not
ask for gratitude. But it is not his generosity that has won
for him the devotion of his servants and employees. They
bow before his certainty. He is a religion to them, a trustworthy
holdfast in this world of unstable things.</p>

<p>And I suppose that is also why he is still &#8220;my friend.&#8221; His
conversation is nothing but a string of affirmations with none
of which I can agree. He is an intolerable bore, and his voice
hurts me. But I regard him with wonder and admiration, and
when the terrors and oppressions of the world threaten to break
my spirit I go to him for strength.</p>

<p>In the early days of our acquaintanceship I used to try, by
facial contortions and parenthetic gesture, to indicate my paltry
disagreement with his political and social creed. Perhaps
I came near at that time to inclusion in the &#8220;Damfool&#8221; category;
but the nearness of my house, his generosity in overlooking
the preliminary marks of my idiocy, and (deciding factor)
the inappeasable craving for company which is his only means
of expression, influenced him to give me another and yet
another chance. He took to putting up the barrage at the least
sign of my disapproval, and so converted me&mdash;outwardly.
While I am with him I relax myself. I stare at him and wonder.
I sometimes find myself wishing that I could be like him!</p>

<p>It was, indeed, the thought of so impossible and outrageous
an ambition that prompted me to attempt this portrait of him.
I have failed, I know, to convey his proper quality. Anyone
who has never met my friend will find nothing but the echo
and shadow of him in this sketch. But is there anyone who
has not met him or some member of his family? Down here
I associate him with the land, but he has business interests
connected with the Stock Exchange. And he has brothers,
uncles and sons&mdash;any number of them&mdash;all of the same virtue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
They are in the Army, the Law, Medicine, in the Pulpit, in
Trade, in the House&mdash;in everything. They are all successful,
and they have all given their services with immense vigour
and volubility to the great task that my friend defines as &#8220;downing
the Hun.&#8221; They are all men of action, and their thinking
is done by a method as simple as simple addition. A few sterling
principles are taken for granted, principles that can be
applied in such phrases as &#8220;the good of the country,&#8221; &#8220;playing
the game,&#8221; &#8220;Rome was not built in a day,&#8221; or &#8220;what I go by is
facts,&#8221; and from these elementary premisses any and every
argument can be deduced by the two-plus-two method. It is
the apotheosis and triumph of a priorism. They do not believe
in induction, and what they do not believe in does not exist
for them. Their strength is in loudness and confidence, and
they are very strong.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, puzzling over my friend and his family in
my own hair-splitting way, I have been wondering if this loudness
is not a sign that the family has lost something of its old
power? Their ancestors, also, were men of simple ideas and
strong passions, men of inflexible purpose. But they were not,
so far as one can judge from history, so blatantly loud. They
bear the same kind of relation to my friend that Lincoln does
to Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Is the type changing, I ask myself, or only the conditions?
And if the latter, is the man of intense convictions and rigid
principles become so much of an anomaly in this new world
of ours that the development of the barrage has become necessary
as a means of assertion against a people who will question
even such a simple premiss as that two added to two invariably
produces four? For they do that. Your characteristic man of
the age will warn you that the mathematical statement is an
assumption only, not a universal truth. He will probably add
that in any case it is useless as an analogy, since it disregards
entirely the qualitative value of &#8220;two.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the over-conscientious mind such criticisms as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
tear away the last hopes of stability. One loses faith in the
Cosmos. But my friend smiles his pity for all such damfoolishness.
His solid feet are planted on the solid earth. He knows
that two and two make four. His ancestors have proved it by
their actions. And if such silly questioning of sound principles
is persisted in, he waves it aside and asserts himself in his usual
effective way.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as I have said, it seems that that form of barrage
was once unnecessary.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE INTROVERT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING is more dispiriting than the practice of classifying
humanity according to &#8220;types.&#8221; Your professional
psychologist does it for his own purposes. This is his way of
collating material for the large generalisation he is always
chasing. His ideal is a complete record. He would like to
present us as so many samples on a labelled card&mdash;the differences
between the samples on any one card being ascribed
to an initial carelessness in manufacture. His method is the
apotheosis of that of the gay Italian fortune-teller one used to
see about the streets, with her little cage of love-birds that sized
you up and picked you out a suitable future. Presently, we
hope, the psychologist will be able to do that for us with a
greater discrimination. He will take a few measurements, test
our reaction times, consult an index, and hand us out an infallible
analysis of our &#8220;type.&#8221; After that we shall know
precisely what we are fitted for, and whether our ultimate
destination is the Woolsack or the Workhouse.</p>

<p>But your psychologist has his uses, and it is the amateur
in this sort, particularly the novel-writing amateur, who arouses
our protest. He&mdash;I use the pronoun asexually&mdash;does not spend
himself in prophecy, but he deals us out into packs with an air
of knowing just where we belong. And his novels prove how
right he was, because you can prove anything in a novel. His
readers like this method. It is easy to understand, and it provides
them with an articulate description of the inevitable
Jones.</p>

<p>I cling to that as some justification for the habit, as an excuse
for my own exhibition of the weakness, however dispiriting.
It is so convenient to have a shorthand reference for Jones
and other of our acquaintances. The proper understanding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
any one of them might engage the leisure of a lifetime; and if
for general purposes we can tuck our friends into some neat
category, we serve the purposes of lucidity.</p>

<p>Lastly, to conclude this apology, I would plead that a new
scheme of classification, such as that provided by psycho-analysis,
is altogether too fascinating to be resisted.</p>

<p>There is, for example, my friend David Wince, the typical
&#8220;introvert,&#8221; and an almost perfect foil for my friend the &#8220;extrovert,&#8221;
previously described. The two men loathe the sight
of one another. Contempt on one side and fear on the other is
a sufficient explanation of their mutual aversion. Wince, indeed,
has an instinctive fear of anything that bellows, and a
rooted distrust of most other things. He suffers from a kind of
spiritual agoraphobia that makes him scared and suspicious of
large generalisations, broad horizons and cognate phenomena.
He likes, as he says, to be &#8220;sure of one step&#8221; before he takes
the next. The open distances of a political argument astound
and terrify him. He takes all discussions with a great seriousness,
and displays an obstructive passion for definition and the
right use of words. &#8220;What I should like to understand&#8221; is a
favourite opening of his, and the thing he would like to understand
is almost invariably some abstruse and fundamental definition.</p>

<p>The <i> priori</i> method is anathema to him. He is, in fact,
characteristically unable to comprehend it. He has little respect
for a syllogism as such, because his mind seems to work
backwards, and all his logical faculty is used in the dissection
of premisses. When my exasperation reaches the stage at which
I say: &#8220;But, my dear fellow, let us take it for granted, for the
sake of argument ...&#8221; he wrings his hands in despair and
replies: &#8220;But that&#8217;s the whole point. We <i>can&#8217;t</i> take these things
for granted. If you don&#8217;t examine your premisses, where <i>are</i>
you?&#8221; He has a habit in conversation of emphasizing such
words as those I have underlined, and a look of desolation
comes into his face when he plaintively enquires where we <i>are</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
At those times I see his timid, irresolute spirit momentarily
staring aghast at the threat of this world&#8217;s immense distances;
before it ducks back with a sigh of relief into the shelter afforded
by his introspective analyses. &#8220;Let us be quite sure of our
ground,&#8221; he says, &#8220;before we draw any deductions.&#8221; His
ground is, I fancy, a kind of &#8220;dug-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He has had an unfortunate matrimonial experience. His
wife ran away with another man, some three or four years ago,
and he is trying to screw himself up to the pitch of divorcing
her. For a man of his sensitiveness, the giving of evidence in
Court upon such a delicate subject will be a very trying ordeal.
He has confided very little of his trouble to me, but occasional
hints of his, and the reports of another friend who knew Mrs.
Wince personally, lead me to suppose that she was rather a
large-minded, robust sort of woman. Perhaps he bored her. I
can imagine that he would bore anyone who had a lust for action;
and as they had been married for eight years and had no
children, I am not prepared to condemn Mrs. Wince, off-hand,
for her desertion of him. I have no doubt that Wince might
be able to make out a good ethical case for himself. I picture
his attitude towards his wife as being extremely self-denying,
deprecatory and almost passionately virtuous. But I prefer to
reserve judgment on the issue between them. I can imagine
that his habit of procrastinating may have annoyed her to desperation.
He has told me with a kind of meek pride that he
has often been to the door of a shop, and then postponed the
purchase he had come to make until the next day. He loathes
shopping. He finds the mildest shopkeeper an intimidating
creature. I do not know what would happen to him if his hairdresser
died. He has been to the same man for over twenty
years.</p>

<p>In politics he is a conscientious Radical, and his one test
of politicians is &#8220;Are they sincere?&#8221; He distrusts the Tories
because he believes that they must be working for their own
personal ends, but he has had a private weakness for Mr. Balfour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
ever since he read <i>The Foundations of Belief</i>. His hero is
W. E. Gladstone, whose opinions represent to him, I fancy,
some aspect of his own, while Gladstone&#8217;s courage, Wince
says, was &#8220;perfectly glorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>He adores courage, but only when it is the self-conscious
kind. Our friend Bellows, for instance, does not appear to
Wince as brave, but as callous, thick-skinned, or &#8220;simply a
braggart.&#8221; All Wince&#8217;s resentment comes to the surface when
the two men meet by some untoward accident. On one such
occasion he magnificently left the room and slammed the door
after him, but I think that he probably regretted that act of
violence before he reached home. He has a nervous horror of
making enemies. He need have no fear in this case. Bellows
considers Wince as beneath his notice, and always speaks of
him to me as &#8220;your hair-splittin&#8217; friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that I have documented Wince I feel chiefly sorry
for him, but when I am in his company I frequently have a
strong desire to shake him. I wonder if his wife began by being
sorry for him, and if her escapade was incidentally intended as
a shaking? Did she flaunt her wickedness at him in the hope
of &#8220;rousing him up&#8221;? If so, she failed, ignominiously. Shakings
of that sort only aggravate his terror of life. Indeed, I do not
think that anything can be done for him. If he survives the
war, the coming of the New Democracy will certainly finish
him. Talking of the possibility of a November Election, he
told me that he meant to abstain from voting. He said that he
could not vote for Lloyd George, and was afraid of putting too
much power into the hands of the Labour Party. He did not
think that they had yet had enough experience of government
to be trusted with the control of a nation.</p>

<p>In the hallowed protections of the Victorian era he had
his place and throve after his fashion. Life was so secure and
the future apparently so certain. But he was not fitted to stand
the strain of coming out into the open. He is horrified by the
war, but in his heart he is still more horrified by the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the conditions that will come with peace. He sees the future,
I know, as a vast, formless threat. He sees life exposed to a great
gale of revolution. He is afraid that his retreat will be no longer
available, that one day he will find his burrow stopped and
himself called upon to face, and to work with, his fellow-men.</p>

<p>But no doubt his natural timidity tends to over-estimate
the probability of these dangers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE BARRIER</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE BODY seems to have a separate and industrious life
of its own. It carries on works of amazing intricacy beyond
the reach of consciousness; works, the very existence of
which are unknown to us so long as they are being successfully
performed. Only when there is some hitch or impediment, is
the consciousness crudely signalled by the message of pain.
Attention is demanded, but no detail is given of the nature of
the trouble, nor of how it may be overcome. All that the message
conveys is a plea for rest, for the suspension of those activities
within the consciousness which are&mdash;may we assume?&mdash;using
up energy from some additional source that the workers
now wish to draw upon themselves.</p>

<p>Can we assume further, that this corporate life of the cells is
not entirely mechanical; is not a series of chemico-biological
reflexes or reactions, somehow mysteriously initiated at the
birth of life and continued by the stimulus of some unknown
unconscious force so long as this plastic, suggestible association
of cells remains active? For example, it would appear that although
strangers from another like community will be accepted
and treated as fellow members, some lack of sympathy, or different
habit of work mars the perfection of the building. In
renewing the bone structure after trephining, for instance, it
has been found that a graft from the patient&#8217;s own body&mdash;thin
slices from the tibia are now being used&mdash;produces better
results than can be achieved by the workers with strange material.
The graft in this case is only used as a scaffolding. (Our
assumed workers with all their ingenuity are not equal to the
task of throwing out cantilevers into the void.) But the planks
of the scaffolding become an organic part of the new structure,
and when the new material used is foreign, we find the marks
of divided purpose in plan and construction. The new bone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
takes longer to form and the work is not so well done.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, it is interesting to notice how impossible our
mechanical metaphors become when we are speaking of this
work of the cells. I have spoken of throwing out a cantilever,
and incorporating the planks of a scaffold in the new structure,
but cantilevers and planks are themselves, also, workers! And,
indeed, the fact that the process cannot be truly stated or even
conceived in mechanical terms may be taken as a contribution
to the metaphysical argument.)</p>

<p>Yet astounding and difficult as is this problem of the civic,
corporate life that is being lived without our knowledge, a still
more inconceivable partnership awaits our investigation. So
far, we have touched only on two domains; the first peculiar
to those who study the body from a more or less mechanical
aspect, such as the surgeon or the histologist; the second to the
psychologist. There remains, I believe, a third peculiar to the
practical experiments of biology and psychology.</p>

<p>Such reflections as these have often haunted me, and my
mind was confusedly feeling for some key to the whole mystery
as I stood by the death-bed of old Henry Sturton. He had
been fatally injured by a motor omnibus as he stood in the gutter
with his pitiful tray of useless twopenny toys. No one else
had been hurt; the accident would have been no accident, nothing
more than a violent and harmless skidding of the juggernaut,
if Henry Sturton had not been standing on that precise
spot. A difference of a few inches either way would have saved
him. As it was the whole performance seemed to have been
fastidiously planned in order to destroy him. And in his pocket
they had found a begging letter addressed to me that he had
perhaps forgotten to post. Or it may be that for once he had
honestly intended to stamp it? I had egotistically wondered if
I was the person for whose benefit this casual killing had been
undertaken.</p>

<p>When I reached the hospital, he was either asleep or unconscious,
but they allowed me to wait within the loop of the
screen that was to hide the spectacle of his passing from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
other patients in the ward. And I stood there pondering on
the marvel of the bodily functions. I got no further than that
until he opened his eyes and I saw my vision.</p>

<p>He had been a gross man. I had always disliked and despised
him since a certain occasion on which I had lunched with
him at his Club. That was more than twenty years ago. I was
young then, full of eagerness for the spiritual adventure of life,
and he was a successful business man of nearly fifty, coarse and
stupid, drugged by his perpetual indulgence in physical satisfactions.
But, indeed, he had always been stupid. He was, I
have heard, the typical lout of his school, too lethargic to be
vicious, living entirely, as it seemed, for his stomach and his
bed. Heaven knows what his life would have been, if he had
always been forced to work for his bare living, but Providence
has a habit of pandering to fat men, and he succeeded to his
father&#8217;s business, and let it run itself on its own familiar lines.</p>

<p>He had never married. He was too selfish for that, but he
had, so someone told me, bought and mistreated more than
one young woman for his own office&mdash;his only positive sin in
the eyes of the moralists; though I used to feel that his whole
existence was one vast overwhelming sin from first to last.
That, however, is the common error of judgment of the ascetic,
self-immolating type.</p>

<p>He found no friends when his business failed. His intimates
were men of the same calibre as himself, and rejected him in
those circumstances as he would have rejected them. The
failure itself was an unlucky accident. The man who ran the
business proved unfaithful; he was the victim of a confidence
that begot in him the lust for power. He gambled, lost, and
absconded.</p>

<p>Sturton&#8217;s descent into the gutter was delayed for a few
years by a clerical appointment he begged from some firm
with whom he had traded before his bankruptcy. The appointment
could not have been lucrative. He attended the office
every day, but nothing else seemed to have been expected
of him. He could have been capable of nothing else. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his potentialities may once have been, they were hopelessly
stultified by then. I used to meet him now and again in those
days of his clerkship; and let him gorge himself at my expense.
That was his single pleasure and desire. Poverty had exaggerated
the cravings of his gluttony.</p>

<p>And as I stood respectfully within the fold of the screen
and looked down at the flabby coarseness of the horrible old
man in the bed, I reflected that his body must in its own way
have represented a highly successful community of cells. There
had been no distractions of purpose in the entity we knew as
Henry Sturton; no rending uncertainties to upset his nerves
and interfere with the steady industry of his bodily functions.</p>

<p>I was thinking that when he opened his eyes and I caught
a glimpse of the fierce and splendid thing his body had always
hidden from us. I saw it then, beyond any shadow of doubt&mdash;the
spirit that had been imprisoned for seventy years, lying in
wait eternally patient and vigilant, for this one brief instant of
expression. It looked at me without recognition, yet with an
amazing intensity, as if it knew that all its long agony of suppression
would find no other compensation than this. So near
release, his soul, still longing to touch life at some point, had
seized its opportunity when that intolerably gross barrier of his
body had been mangled and dislocated by this long-delayed
accident.</p>

<p>Then Henry Sturton coughed, and I saw the beautiful
eager stare die out of his eyes, and give place to that look of
gross desire I had always loathed. Even then, I believe, he
craved for food. But the next moment his eyes closed and his
lips spurted a stream of blood.</p>

<p>The nurse was with him instantly, pushing me aside. I
took advantage of her preoccupation to stay till the end. I
hoped for one more sight of his soul. I thought it might take
advantage of another intermission before the work of the community
was abruptly closed. But I did not see it again.</p>

<p>He spoke once, two minutes before he died.</p>

<p>&#8220;God blast,&#8221; was what he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE CONVERT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR the first time in his life, Henry Wolverton had been
seriously upset.</p>

<p>His had been an orderly life. Even when he was at Shrewsbury,
he had escaped bullying and other disturbances. He had
been marked out as a future scholar who would be a credit to
the school; and his calm air of reserve had also protected him.
He might be classed as a &#8220;swat,&#8221; but he was not the kind of
swat who gets singled out for bullying. He was no good at
games, but he had a handsome, dignified presence, and he was
never known to put on side.</p>

<p>At Oxford he passed from triumph to triumph. After he
got his fellowship at Balliol, he married a girl-graduate from
Lady Margaret Hall, and they worked happily together on his
research. He was writing in many volumes, the <i>Economic
History of the Sixteenth &amp; Seventeenth Centuries</i>; and at twenty-nine
he was already an authority. His wife died rather incidentally
when they had been married three years, but that had
not seriously interfered with his life work.</p>

<p>Nor did the war, although it was a terrible nuisance, have
any considerable effect upon him. He undertook work of
&#8220;national importance&#8221; in Whitehall, and when he returned
home in the afternoon to the house he had taken at the corner
of Bedford Square, he found that he could still put in four or
five valuable hours&#8217; work on his history. And if he wanted
extra time for research in the British Museum library, he could
always get leave. Everyone in his department recognized the
fact that he was an exceptional man, and that the work he was
engaged upon would be a lasting monument to English scholarship.</p>

<p>By comparison, the war itself was almost an ephemeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
thing.</p>

<p>Since the signing of the armistice, he had settled down to
make up for lost time. He had his whole future planned. He
hoped to finish his immediate task by the time he was sixty-five,
but he foresaw that there would still be other work for
him to do. He would, for example, almost certainly find it
necessary by then to make revision in his earlier volumes.</p>

<p>It was no trifle that had upset him on this particular day.
But even the fact that the English revolution had at last broken
into the flame of civil war would not have disturbed him
so seriously, if he had not conclusively proved in the course
of the past five weeks that the revolution was impossible.
Throughout the welter of the national strike disturbances,
editors of any importance from the editor of the <i>Times</i> downwards
had begged him for articles. Although he had specialized
upon a study of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, he was
regarded as the first authority on the entire history of the English
people. And in his articles, he had proved conclusively
from his vast knowledge of precedents and tradition, that the
temper of the English people would never seek the arbitrament
of an armed revolution.</p>

<p>He was still convinced of that, although, so far as he could
judge, the revolution had already begun.</p>

<p>He had been startled in the middle of his best hours of the
day, by what he had at first imagined to be the back-firing of
a rapidly driven motor-bicycle. He went to the window,
opened it wide (he always kept it closed when he was working,
to shut out the noise of the traffic), and listened with an anxious
attention. He had a peculiar and unprecedented feeling of
nervousness. He felt, for no assignable reason, as if someone
had discovered a bad anachronism in his book. And then he
was reluctantly driven to the conclusion that, indeed, some
mistake had been committed, although he could not admit that
it was his own. For the motor-bicycle continued to back-fire
in short, spasmodic bursts, while it remained stationary; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he could do longer avoid the inference that it was as a matter
of fact a machine gun, no further away than Oxford Street.
He could, also, hear dim and terrible shouting, and more faintly,
occasional cries of dismay, of anger, or of fear.</p>

<p>The Square was completely deserted, but when he saw a
scattered rout of people flying north, up Bloomsbury Street, he
closed the window and began to pace up and down his well-fitted
writing room, sanctified now, by the five years&#8217; work he
had done there.</p>

<p>What so annoyed and disturbed him was that some officious,
political fool should have upset his scholarly deductions
from the vast precedents of history. He would not admit for
one moment that he had been mistaken; his chain of reasoning
was unassailable. But, so he inferred, some blundering, malicious
idiot had made a gross error in the conduct of the negotiations
that, no longer ago than yesterday, had promised so
hopefully. The result of that error was incalculable. There
could be no doubt that the rioters had been fired upon, and so
given a sound cause, and what would perhaps be more effective
still, a rallying cry, to the great mass of unemployed workers.
And the army could not be depended upon. The more loyal
part of it was in Germany enforcing the peace terms. It was
just possible in the circumstances that there might be something
very like an armed revolution, despite the fact that his arguments
had been so indubitably sound and right. Henry Wolverton
was exceedingly annoyed and upset.</p>

<p>His troubles did not end there. Just as he had succeeded, by
a masterly effort of concentration, in putting away the thought
of this stupid anomaly and returning to his work, his housekeeper
came and tapped at his door&mdash;a thing she had been
explicitly forbidden to do, at that time of day, in any circumstances
whatever.</p>

<p>He ignored the first knock, and then she knocked again,
more loudly.</p>

<p>He frowned, and bade her come in. She was stupid, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
most women, and would probably continue to pester him until
she was admitted.</p>

<p>She came in trembling with agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m sure I beg your pardon, sir, coming now, against
all orders,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but William has just come in&mdash;it&#8217;s his
evening off, you know, sir&mdash;and he says there&#8217;s been firin&#8217; in
Oxford Circus, and people killed, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I inferred that,&#8221; Henry Wolverton interrupted her calmly.
&#8220;I heard the machine guns. You had better tell William
not to go out again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sir, but he says we&#8217;re none of us safe,&#8221; the housekeeper
wailed, on the verge of hysterics. &#8220;He says there&#8217;ll be
looting and Heaven only knows what, and us so near Oxford
Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not anticipate any effects of that kind, to-night, Mrs.
Perry,&#8221; Wolverton replied frigidly. &#8220;And, by the way, I
should be glad if you could let me have dinner half an hour
earlier, this evening. After these annoying disturbances, I may
not be able to settle down again until I have dined, and I shall
work longer afterwards to make up for lost time. Can you
arrange that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; gasped Mrs. Perry. &#8220;Then, you don&#8217;t believe,
sir&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not,&#8221; Wolverton returned with the dignity of the
assured. &#8220;You may lock the outer doors, if it gives you any
sense of security. I shall expect dinner in half an hour from
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Perry returned to the kitchen greatly comforted by
her master&#8217;s magnificent confidence. She told William that
things were not so bad as he was afraid of! And William in
his turn derived a sense of security from the knowledge that
he was living in the house of Henry Wolverton.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they locked and bolted all the doors with a
fine attention to detail.</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton worked rather intermittently after dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that night. He was not disturbed by any noises from
without. London was quieter than he had ever known it. He
could hear no sound of traffic either along Bloomsbury Street
or Tottenham Court Road. No paper boys came. No one
passed his window. He could not even hear the sound of the
policeman on his beat. But he found the absence of noise on
this occasion more disturbing than the presence of it would
have been. He found himself hailed out of his profoundest
efforts of attention by his consciousness of this abiding, deathly
silence. He would discover himself, sitting idly, listening to
the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>A little after twelve o&#8217;clock, he got up and went to the
front door. And after he had somewhat impatiently unlocked
it, drawn back the bottom bolt and the top bolt, released the
night latch, and undone the chain, he opened the door and
stood on the top step, looking out over the darkness of the
Square. After a moment or two, he realized with a little shock
of dismay why the Square looked unfamiliar to him. The
street lamps had not been lighted. Only a clear and brilliant
moon in its second quarter, brooded over the unprecedented
silence; weakly illuminating the apparently deserted city....</p>

<p>The thin scream of fear that suddenly pierced the stillness,
came with an effect of audacious irreverence.</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton stiffened and a cold thrill of apprehension
ran down his spine.</p>

<p>The scream was succeeded by a faint, eager patter of
hurrying feet; and then more distantly, by the brutal intrusion
of hoarse shouts, and the clutter of heavy boots vehemently
running.</p>

<p>Wolverton did not move. Until now fear had never entered
his life and he had the courage of a man who has never
faced a real danger.</p>

<p>The lighter footsteps were approaching very rapidly, coming
up Bloomsbury Street; and the sound of them seemed
suddenly to lift and acquire precision as a figure came round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the corner and turned swiftly into the Square. Wolverton
could see then that the runner was a young woman in a light
dress.</p>

<p>He would have let her pass without trying to attract her
attention. He was watching the whole incident with the
detached and careful interest of the historian. But the young
woman, herself, had evidently seen the beacon of his open door
before she actually reached it, and had settled upon her course
of action. She came straight up the steps without an instant&#8217;s
hesitation, pushed Henry Wolverton back into the hall, and
closed the door with the intent and silent urgency of a conspirator.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to speak, and the young woman
crouched in silence behind the door, until they had heard the
clutter of heavy footsteps pass by and hurry on, up the Square.
The men were not shouting now, but even through the heavy
door, Wolverton could hear them gasping and panting as they
ran. The sound of it made him think of the hoarse panting of
great dogs.</p>

<p>When the flurry of that passing had dwindled again into
silence, the young woman got up, locked and bolted the door
and faced Henry Wolverton under the light of the hall lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she said, with a little laugh of exultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand&mdash;?&#8221; Wolverton began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably, I should imagine,&#8221; she interrupted him. &#8220;The
scum&#8217;s let loose&mdash;the hooligans; the Apaches. After the fighting
comes pillage and rapine.&#8221; She frowned slightly as she
added, &#8220;I suppose rapine has got to do with rape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not used specifically in that sense, now,&#8221; Wolverton
replied. &#8220;But it had that meaning, earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks! Well that was what I meant,&#8221; the young
woman said. &#8220;Do you mind if I come in and sit down? Is
that your room? I&#8217;m a bit blown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wolverton stood aside for her to enter the sacred places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of his writing-room.</p>

<p>She nodded by way of thanks, as she passed him, went in,
looked round the room and then having thrown herself with
a sigh of relief into his reading chair, proceeded to take off her
hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jolly room,&#8221; she remarked pleasantly, as her deft fingers
twitched and patted at her hair. &#8220;You a writer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Henry Wolverton,&#8221; he informed her with
a modest dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she exclaimed, sitting bolt upright and staring
at him eagerly. &#8220;Henry Wolverton, the historian?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; she said, and went on, &#8220;Well, I was wrong
about one thing. I said you must be a dried up little mummy
of a man, all beard and spectacles. And you&#8217;re not a bit like
that. In fact you&#8217;re quite unusually goodlooking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The faintest adumbration of a flush tinged Wolverton&#8217;s
white forehead. &#8220;My name appears to be known to you,&#8221; he
remarked, ignoring the compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obviously,&#8221; his visitor retorted. &#8220;Pretty well known to
everyone, I should imagine, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask why?&#8221; he put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, considering that you&#8217;re the man who&#8217;s responsible
for the revolution, I suppose you&#8217;re more famous at the present
moment than any man in Great Britain,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Though
you&#8217;re not exactly popular with either side, to-night, I should
think,&#8221; she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton made a little noise in his throat that
sounded like an asthmatic cough. With him that noise did
duty for a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t follow you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t admit your own responsibility
for the revolution?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot see that I am even remotely connected with it,&#8221;
he replied.</p>

<p>The young woman pursed her lovely mouth, and clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
her hands round her knee. After a reflective pause she remarked
with apparent inconsequence, &#8220;My name is Susan Jeffery; but
I don&#8217;t suppose that conveys anything to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I saw the name on a committee list of the &#8216;League
of Youth,&#8217;&#8221; Wolverton said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, what a memory he has,&#8221; commented Susan Jeffery
in a soft voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must plead ignorance of the general scope of your
activities,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know something about our league?&#8221; she put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as our policy of percolation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that your endeavour is to be represented in
every imaginable grade of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. From royalty down to the criminal and the
gutter-snipe,&#8221; Susan confirmed. &#8220;We have only one qualification
for membership; we admit no one over twenty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you many members, now?&#8221; Wolverton inquired
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine thousand, eight hundred and forty-three,&#8221; Susan
replied. &#8220;We admitted a hundred and seven new members
after our grand meeting to-night, including a royal prince and
two hooligans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton nodded his head encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most satisfactory,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>Susan dropped her knee and sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you this,&#8221; she said in a firm voice, &#8220;for your
own good. We discussed you at our meeting, and it was resolved
unanimously that you were largely responsible for the
revolution that broke out to-day, and will end God knows
where or when.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wolverton made his noise again&mdash;Susan had not yet recognized
it as a laugh. &#8220;I must confess that I don&#8217;t quite
follow your train of reasoning,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t <i>look</i> like a fool, either,&#8221; Susan commented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
frankly. &#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s just your one blind spot. Most of us
have one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would explain,&#8221; Wolverton suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so bally obvious,&#8221; Susan replied. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been writing
articles for the last six weeks&mdash;they&#8217;ve appeared all over
the shop&mdash;rubbing it in about the English temper. It wouldn&#8217;t
have mattered if it had been anybody else, but people believe
<i>you</i>. All sorts of people. We know that, through the activities
of the league, because we&#8217;re represented everywhere. Well,
what has been the effect of those articles? One side, the side
in power, has believed you and decided on your authority not
to give way. The other side, the workers, has believed you,
too, and they&#8217;re so annoyed to think that you are right that
they&#8217;ve determined to prove you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, in that case, I was right,&#8221; Wolverton put in with
his first sign of excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were, until you put your opinion on record,&#8221; Susan
corrected him. &#8220;You see,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;it&#8217;s like knowing
the future. You can only know it for certain about other
people as long as you keep it to yourself. If you tell a man that
next Friday he&#8217;ll walk under a ladder in Fleet Street, and that
a brick will drop on his head and kill him, he&#8217;ll keep out of
Fleet Street next Friday, if he believes you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit the instance,&#8221; Wolverton murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just the same in your case. The workers have
been saying, &#8216;Here&#8217;s that chap Wolverton convincing everybody
that there&#8217;ll be no revolution, that we&#8217;ll have to give in,
in the end, and make terms. And all the politicians, and the
owners and the middle classes believe him, and they&#8217;ll stick it
out to the last minute, because they&#8217;re sure we have got the
&#8220;English temper&#8221; and won&#8217;t fight. Well, we&#8217;ll jolly well
prove that Mr. Wolverton is wrong for once.&#8217; You see,&#8221; Susan
concluded with a graceful gesture. &#8220;Our league knows
these things. And it comes to this: if you want your prophecies
to come off, you must keep them to yourself until after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
event. Hasn&#8217;t your study of history taught you that much?&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton leaned forward in his chair and covered
his face with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve upset you,&#8221; Susan said gently. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
you&#8217;re a very nice man, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wolverton groaned. &#8220;I&#8217;m finally discredited,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Susan comforted him. &#8220;Not in your own line.
Remember the motto of our League: &#8216;These things are hidden
from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes.&#8217; No man,
however clever he is, can be expected to know everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton lifted his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never write again,&#8221; he said, in the tone of one who
makes the great renunciation; and he looked at Susan a trifle
nervously, as if he feared this immense announcement might
be a little too much for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as well,&#8221; she replied soothingly. &#8220;In any case we&#8217;ve
pretty well scrapped history now. It was never any practical
use except as a reference for precedents; and now we&#8217;re chucking
precedents down the sink as fast as we can. We&#8217;re all going
to begin again presently&mdash;when the fighting is over&mdash;on a
new basis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton jumped to his feet and began to pace
up and down the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure to be a wrench at first, of course,&#8221; Susan consoled
him. &#8220;These things always are. But if I can help you in any
way&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on her with the first sign of emotional passion
he had ever displayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he said fiercely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize that you&#8217;ve
destroyed my whole life&#8217;s work; that you&#8217;ve robbed me in
ten minutes of every happiness and satisfaction I&#8217;ve ever had.
Good God, if I&#8217;d known, I&#8217;d have slammed the door in your
face, just now. I would have delivered you over to the scum
of London to do what they would with you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Susan blushed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a very nice thing to
say,&#8221; she remarked, gently. &#8220;But perhaps it&#8217;s just as well for
you to blow off steam a bit. It does help when you&#8217;ve had a
real facer. And honestly, you know, although I&#8217;m very sorry
in a way, I do think it&#8217;s all for your good that I came in to-night;
because you would have been bound to find it out for yourself
sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton stared at her, and his look of anger
slowly gave place to one of bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what am I to <i>do</i>?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always worked
for ten hours a day. I can&#8217;t live without work of some kind,
and now....&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan got up and came across the room to him, with an
expression of bright and eager helpfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! look here, we&#8217;ll find a use for you,&#8221; she said, laying
her hand on his arm. &#8220;You&#8217;re too old to join the league, of
course&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thirty-seven,&#8221; he interpolated.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite young, really,&#8221; she comforted him. &#8220;I&#8217;m twenty-three.
But what I was going to say was that we are founding
a reference committee of experts of all kinds to advise the
league. The members of that committee will have no voice
in our decisions, you understand; they&#8217;ll be simply advisory.
And it would be absolutely splendid to have you as chairman.
I shall get no end of prestige from the league for having found
you.&#8221; Her face shone with the joy of the successful discoverer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you to suggest,&#8221; Henry Wolverton commented
dryly, &#8220;that I should devote the rest of my life, and
the&mdash;er&mdash;fruits of my scholarship, to instructing young men
and women under twenty-five years of age in the lessons of
history; always with the distinct understanding that they are
in no way pledged to apply my advice in the prosecution of
their own policy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan did not miss the implications of his tone. &#8220;My dear
man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;whatever is the good of scholarship, if it isn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to advise the young? Surely you haven&#8217;t been studying history
all these years just in order to swap opinions with all the other
old fogies?&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton turned his back on her and walked over
to the window. After a short pause he faced her again and
said, &#8220;You have a remarkable power of statement, Miss Jeffery.
I must admit that I have never before considered the precise
use, in the pragmatical sense, to which I might apply my&mdash;er&mdash;scholarship;
and I am ready to grant that your point is a
good one. Where your otherwise admirable logic seems to
fail, however, is in the admission that though I might turn my
knowledge to good effect by advising youth, I may be wasting
all my effort since youth will probably not be guided by my
teaching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about logic,&#8221; replied Susan, &#8220;but I
should have thought it must be pretty evident to you, to-day
of all days, that if we were going to be guided only by the
lessons of history, our league would be a back-number in a
week. Isn&#8217;t it possible for you to get it into your head that
history isn&#8217;t everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her last question with the appealing gesture of a
mother addressing a refractory and rather stupid child.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is history going to get us out of the mess you&#8217;ve
landed us in, for example?&#8221; she continued, as Henry Wolverton
made no attempt to answer her. &#8220;How is history, alone,
going to help us presently to start everything afresh on a new
basis? You must know, yourself, that it&#8217;s no good trying to
get back to the old way of doing things. That could only
mean, by your own showing, that we should just be preparing
the way for all this to happen again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton threw up his hands with a gesture of
despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I admit that you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have to face
the conclusion that I&#8217;ve wasted my whole life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in a way, I&#8217;m afraid you have, rather,&#8221; Susan admitted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a great pity, for instance, about this revolution
of yours. It means such a lot of blood and disorder; and people
do get so out of hand when there&#8217;s fighting going on. Now if
the owners and the middle-classes hadn&#8217;t been so cocksure, and
had given way, we could have started in on our new methods
of government without any bother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused a moment, before she added,</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got it all worked out, you know, but, of course, I
can&#8217;t tell you anything about it, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, in fact, what you would call a back-number,&#8221; Henry
Wolverton said.</p>

<p>Susan puckered her forehead. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s still a hope
for you,&#8221; she remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all these years?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d let me take you in hand for a bit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
seem willing to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have surely more important work to do? You
couldn&#8217;t spare time to teach me?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I might work it in,&#8221; she said reflectively. &#8220;I&#8217;d
take you about with me and show you things&mdash;real things,
you know. What&#8217;s chiefly wrong with you is that you&#8217;ve
spent all your time over your old books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You suggest that I ought to study life in&mdash;in action?&#8221;
Henry Wolverton inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; Susan agreed. &#8220;You ought to come to one of
our meetings.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, and her hand went up to her mouth
with a gesture of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Great Scott!&#8221; she ejaculated; &#8220;that reminds me, I
was going on to another frightfully important meeting when
those hooligans started chasing me; and that and our talk put
it right out of my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At what time was this important meeting to be held?&#8221;
Henry Wolverton asked, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;One o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she told him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;You still have ten minutes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Susan shuddered. &#8220;I daren&#8217;t go out again alone,&#8221; she confessed.
&#8220;I simply daren&#8217;t. I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d sooner stay here all night
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted to come with you,&#8221; Henry Wolverton
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Susan exclaimed. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you understand the
risk? The mob&#8217;s loose. What good would you be against three
or four chunky hooligans?&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Wolverton squared his shoulders. He was a tall,
finely-built man, and his face had the cool assurance of one
who has never known fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of hooligans,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Susan gazed at him with frank admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you&#8217;re a perfect topper in some ways,&#8221; she
complimented him.</p>

<p>He bowed gravely. &#8220;If I might be admitted to this meeting
of yours,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it would perhaps afford me an opportunity
to begin my education.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re not afraid,&#8221; Susan replied, picking
up her hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the least afraid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will you take my
arm?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the open door they paused a moment, looking out into
the darkness; listening to the profound silence of the empty
night&mdash;creative youth and patient scholarship, hand-in-hand,
facing the immense void of the unforetellable future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">A NEGLIGIBLE EXPERIMENT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;CAN&#8217;T get him right, somehow,&#8221; the young sculptor
said, but he looked tenderly at the little figure of the man
he was modelling in plasticine, as if, despite its very obvious
defects, he found something to admire in his creation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wants stiffening, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
you put a wire or something up his legs and back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; my young friend explained, &#8220;I could if I
knew beforehand exactly what I was going to do with him.
Only I don&#8217;t. I like to make him up as I go along. I&#8217;m no
good at it really. I can&#8217;t think it all out ahead and then sit
down and do it right off. I have to experiment and&mdash;see how
it comes, you know. Do you think his head is too big?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought it was rather big.</p>

<p>The young modeller regarded his creation with a look in
which fondness still seemed to preponderate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps if....&#8221; he said; then speech died out of him as
his hands again began to fashion and improve his little image of
humanity.</p>

<p>And as I watched him a vision came to me. I lost consciousness
of the boy and his workshop. I wandered away into
a dreamland of the imagination, following the lure of a fantasy
deeper and more satisfying than the reality of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I read in my morning&#8217;s paper of the &#8220;Nova&#8221; in the
constellation of Sagittarius, I thought first of H. G. Wells&#8217;s
story of &#8220;The New Star,&#8221; and smiled. Later, I turned with a
little shiver of anxiety to that chapter in Professor Lowell&#8217;s
<i>Evolution of Worlds</i> in which he describes the possible coming
of a &#8220;dark stranger&#8221; out of the depths of space. Already there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
were points of striking resemblance between Lowell&#8217;s imaginative
account and the details that were appearing casually, in
the intervals between more important news, in the newspapers.
This new star differed from those other <i>nov</i> so many
of which have been recorded at various times. <i>They</i> brought
us tidings of a collision that had already occurred, blazing out
suddenly into a short-lived splendour and quickly waning
again to invisibility. This stranger, astronomers were agreed,
shone not by its own light but by the reflected light of the
sun. Then it must be, relatively, near. Lowell&#8217;s calculations
gave us something like thirty years to prepare before the invader
wrought the destruction of the solar system. But,
obviously, that calculation depended on various assumptions
that the reality need not verify. This strange visitor might be
much smaller than he had assumed&mdash;he had taken the enormous
mass of the sun as his standard&mdash;its albedo might be
lower; its speed greater. Also Lowell&#8217;s stranger was assumed
to be coming at right angles to the plane of the ecliptic; this
one would, as it were, skim the edge of that swimming saucer.
Would any of the outer planets be interposed between us and
this dreadful visitor? Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, might any of them be a buffer to us&mdash;provide us, perhaps,
with some stupendous display in the heavens, but save
us from ultimate disaster?</p>

<p>Everyone treated the thing so lightly. Here and there
alarmist paragraphs appeared, but they only displayed the hand
of the sensation-monger. No one took the threat seriously.
And yet the astronomers must know? They had had more
than a week, now, in which to make their calculations.</p>

<p>And then the shadow fell with such suddenness that it
was impossible to say how the certainty had come to us.
Everyone knew. The astronomers confirmed one another
without a dissentient. And there was nothing in the way.
With a horrible unanimity the outer planets had left a clear
space for the intruder, while the Earth, with that blundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
indifference which is surely its chief characteristic, was stolidly
marching straight into the path of destruction. Is there any
esoteric significance in the fact that the Earth has a greater
density than any other member of the solar system?</p>

<p>Everyone knew, but little was changed. We went on
with our affairs; with little zest, no doubt&mdash;we could never
forget the deepening shadow. But what else was there for us
to do but go on? We could not instantly alter ourselves or
our way of life. Religions blazed into a spasmodic fever as
men and women sought refuge from the dreadful reality.
Crimes of lust and greed increased for the same reason. But
for the most part we continued in the old ways by sheer inertia,
though there was a new and smaller moon visible to us in the
night sky, a moon that waxed with infinite slowness towards
the full, and grew larger night by night. We knew by then
that the stranger was as big as Jupiter, and with a density little
less than that of the Earth.</p>

<p>The first portents of disaster came when our own moon
was approaching the new. The stranger&#8217;s mass had begun to
affect the tides, and we were warned to evacuate all low lands,
near the sea, upon the estuaries, and incidentally the river level
in London. Four days before the highest tide the Thames
flooded Farringdon Street, Westminster, and great districts on
the south bank, and the retreating river laid bare the river-bed
as far down as Greenwich.</p>

<p>The population of London had fled to the heights North
and South before the great floods that devastated all the low
lands of Essex, Kent, Surrey, and Middlesex. And with that
rush for safety and the rapidly increasing portents of disaster
the routine of civilisation was definitely broken. It seemed as
if in the mass we were being gradually stripped of all our
tediously-acquired virtues and vices, until but one instinct
remained, the instinct for self-preservation. That, however,
was only the effect produced by the panic movement of the
crowd; when one came to individuals....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>I can, however, only speak of two, myself and another
man. We sat together on a hill in Derbyshire and watched
through the last night.</p>

<p>A certain calmness had come to me, then, mingled with
the queerest feelings of excitement and expectation. Within
sight of death, I could still enjoy this amazing celestial adventure.
The new planet that was rushing in upon us had already
torn us from our steady path about the sun, and our old familiar
moon dwindled to the size of a sixpence, and, diminishing
almost visibly, was within a few hours of destruction. For the
moon had fled its old allegiance to the Earth and was rushing
to the arms of this great stranger like some passionate, unfaithful
lover.</p>

<p>But the new planet itself drowned all consciousness of
lesser things when it rose magnificently above the eastern horizon.
That night it was a full circle of yellow light, and across
its great expanse moved one circle of intense blackness, the
size of our old moon, a circle that was slowly increasing in
size, the shadow of our own Earth. So great a thing appeared
this new planet, then, that when its lower rim was at last clear
of the horizon, its upper limb towered half-way to the zenith.
It had few markings, but from one pole, which was turned
markedly towards us, radiated uneven, dark lines&mdash;chains of
mountains, perhaps&mdash;that definitely produced the effect of a
solid globe long before its actual convexity was recognisable.
All the rest of the planet presented a smooth, unbroken expanse,
possibly the vast bed of some long-vanished sea.</p>

<p>For an hour or more my companion and I had sat in silence
watching this gigantic spectacle; then he said quietly, &#8220;We
are witnessing the failure of a negligible experiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not answer at once. I had not caught his drift. I
was struggling with a foolish preoccupation, the result of an
almost lifelong habit. As I watched I was searching for words
to describe what I saw. I wanted to write my experience;
yes, even there, under the sentence of death pronounced not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
only upon me, but upon all humanity, I was struggling with
this meaningless desire to create a record that none could ever
read.</p>

<p>I made an effort and roused myself from this inane preoccupation.
&#8220;Negligible?&#8221; I said, grasping at what seemed to
be his most prominent word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Proved to be negligible,&#8221; he asserted. &#8220;You are a serious
man? You don&#8217;t cling to straws? You have no doubt that
this is the end of the Earth? Very well then, you know that
we are to be destroyed? By an accident? Possibly. Or it may
be that this arrow that has been discharged at us was shot deliberately;
with a definite purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t as if the same thing had not happened before,&#8221;
he continued after a pause. &#8220;We have seen it&mdash;seen the effects
at least. When some temporary star blazed up in the sky,
we inferred some such collision as this. It may very well be
that from a planet in some other system men may catch sight
of this tiny blaze of ours&mdash;and wonder. It will be relatively
a very small affair. Some of those we&#8217;ve seen must have been
many thousand times greater.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the point is that this experiment of making men
upon the Earth is now proved to be negligible. In a few hours
it will be finished, wiped out. And whether that termination
is the result of accident or design makes no difference to the
effect. This is an answer to all our philosophies and religions.
Either we are the creatures of some chance evolutionary process,
or we are an experiment that has failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him, and noted with a curious stir of unplaceable
recollection that his head was too large.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certain that we shall go off like an exploded shell?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy that many of us will live to see that,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;Most of us will be drowned in the next tide. It
will come in a wall of water many thousand feet high. Don&#8217;t
you notice a feeling of lightness in your body? The attraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of this great stranger is beginning to drag at us. On the other
side of the Earth men are feeling an intolerable heaviness. And
our speed increases. We have been drawn out of our orbit.
We are rushing now to greet the stranger with a kiss of fire.
Our circling about the sun is done for ever. We and the
stranger are leaping together like two bubbles in a cup.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe some hours passed before I spoke again. A sense
of imminence had grown upon me in the meantime. I was
aware of the guards that were fetching me to execution.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;there may still be such a thing as an
immortal soul. Though every physical expression is smashed
at one blow, that does not prove....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no such thing as proof possible,&#8221; my companion
interrupted. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you know in your heart that it&#8217;s no
good?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;No good. It&#8217;s no good.&#8221; I woke with a start at the repetition
of that statement.</p>

<p>My young modeller was rolling a great ball of plasticine,
and before I could stop him he had thrown it with deadly accuracy
at his effigy of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t come right,&#8221; he explained, picked up the
shapeless mass of clay, and tossed it carelessly into a corner of
the workshop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you shouldn&#8217;t have done that,&#8221; I said, with the
incurable didacticism of the pedagogue.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE MIRACLE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;<i>I &#8217;M</i> dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard the voice, <i>his</i> voice, speaking distinctly, with
something of the same fatalism, half-careless, half-resentful,
that he had used when he returned to France after their five
short days of married life. For one moment she believed that
it was actually his voice, that he had come suddenly and wonderfully
out of his six weeks&#8217; insensibility, to a doubting interrogation
of the darkness. But even as she fumbled impatiently
for the switch of the electric light, she knew that the voice had
not come from the bed on the further side of the room, but had
spoken its horrible message close, very close, to her ear&mdash;intimately,
confidentially, with a touch of swaggering, careless
courage.</p>

<p>And as the light, with an effect of servile obedience, disclosed
the room at her touch of the switch, she had no least
hope that she would be the witness of the longed-for miracle;
that she would see him who had lain so long a lax and useless
counterfeit of his vigorous self, half raised and questioning the
unfamiliar surroundings with his pitiful assertion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she got out of bed, a slight pathetic figure in
the white light that searched out every corner of the room, and
crossed to where he lay inert and flaccid.</p>

<p>No, there was no change in him. The enigma that had
baffled all the specialists still persisted. He was still the living
dead man who had been ejected with just one little sobbing
gasp of air out of the narrow tunnel, the bore of his own body,
by the premature explosion of the mine he had spent six weeks&#8217;
labour in laying. On the further side that explosion had blown
out the flank of a hill, but he who had stoppered the narrow
vent on the hither side, like a plug of damp earth in the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of a rifle-barrel, had been softly expelled into the presence of
his fellow-sappers waiting at the junction of the wider tunnel
they had bored, with never a mark of injury on him. Even his
hair, which had been so near&mdash;a paltry twenty feet or so&mdash;to
the charge that had lifted goodness knows how many tons of
earth and stone sky-high&mdash;even his hair had not been singed.</p>

<p>His body, almost incredibly, had come unscathed from its
open sight of death, but something&mdash;his wife thought of it as
his spirit&mdash;had been instantly shocked into silence. Since that
awful experience he had given no sign of consciousness or of
volition. His bodily functions continued their offices with a
slow, dull persistence&mdash;he was fed artificially now and again
to remedy the slight waste of tissue&mdash;but his spirit gave no
least sign of its occupancy.</p>

<p>The specialists had been greatly interested, but he had
given them so little material for actual experiment that they had
yielded to his wife&#8217;s urgent request, and yesterday he had been
transferred to her immediate care in the reasonably convenient
Maida Vale flat in which they had spent their too restricted
honeymoon....</p>

<p>She leant over him now and stared into his composed impassive
face, every feature of which was steady with the challenging
quiet of death. Where was he? she wondered. What
could she conceivably do to reach him through that unresponsive
instrument on the bed&mdash;an instrument that appeared as
useless now as an unstrung piano?</p>

<p>And the voice, that had made its immense admission with
the desperate gallantry of one who had flung up his arms and
acknowledged himself prisoner to the great enemy&mdash;whence
had come the voice? She could remember no antecedent dream.
The sound of his speaking had wakened her, and in the act of
waking she had heard his surrender made, as clearly as if he
had spoken it with his mouth at her ear. She felt that she could
hear it still. That reckless sentence was yet ringing through
the room: &#8220;<i>I&#8217;m</i> dead.&#8221; Just so, she thought, might he have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
said &#8220;Kamerad&#8221; in face of some overwhelmingly superior force.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re <i>not</i>; you&#8217;re not dead,&#8221; she pleaded to that insensible
figure; &#8220;you&#8217;re alive if&mdash;if you would but come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She might as well have strummed on the keyboard of a
wireless piano for all the reaction she could produce from the
lax representative that lay before her, but her own verbal image
returned to her with another question.</p>

<p>Come back? From where? Where was <i>he</i> now&mdash;the individuality
she addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;? Was that essential personality
of his buried deep in this spiritless automaton, or was it
away somewhere in the void, unaware both of its fleshly anchor
and of her? Could she not reach that spirit of his, poised out
of time and space, by the powers of her own love and longing,
since they, too, surely were able to transcend the limitations
of the purely physical? But to do that she must not sit and gaze
at this empty replica on the bed; she must think not of his
image, but of <i>him</i>, not of the representative, but of the spirit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when she began to pace the length of the
room, she found that when the sight of her husband&#8217;s placid
face was hidden some stimulus to concentration was removed
also. While she stared at him her thought was held and focused,
now she was distracted by her vision of the familiar things
that were associated with her past life in his company. She
was thinking, not of him, but of the things he had done, the
man he had been.</p>

<p>Perhaps darkness might help her, she thought, and she laid
herself down on the bed and once more quenched the obedient
light.</p>

<p>For a time she lay still, staring into the blackness, clenched
in a vivid effort of concentration, and then her eyes closed, and
even as she protested that she would not sleep, she had a vision
of herself lying inert and pale on her own bed, even as he was
lying.</p>

<p>Then she seemed to be rising, baffled and half-unwilling,
through wreaths of a palpable darkness that clung about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with a dragging, suffocating weight. And then it seemed to her
that she was wandering, lost and perplexed, on a gaunt and
arid plain that might once have been the bed of a now vanished
sea.</p>

<p>She was not alone. Other figures, wraiths of humanity,
also wandered here and there. But none noticed her. They
moved as if they were searching for something they could never
hope to find. They peered vaguely downwards, passing her
with bent heads and eyes that sought the ground with a reluctant
determination....</p>

<p>She found herself trembling, not with horror, but with a
rapture of expectancy. She had become aware that one among
these drifting wraiths was moving definitely towards her, drawn
by the power of her longing. And she had command of the
power, so that it was ecstasy to wield it. Almost she was tempted
to withhold her amazing strength in order to taste again
the pleasure of its renewed exercise.</p>

<p>Then with a sense of some lost interval she found herself
face to face with him. But he looked at her without a sign of
recognition. His eyes, too, were full of that aimless intention,
as though he was under an eternal command to search for some
unknown thing that was hidden he knew not where.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul!&#8221; she cried to him.</p>

<p>He made no reply. He did not seem to have heard her.
But still she was conscious of her immense power over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul,&#8221; she said again. &#8220;Come back with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her then; but now it was as if he could not see her.
He looked about him, half-startled, half-resentful. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no way back from the plains of France,&#8221; he said, and a sudden
doubt shook her. Her power to hold him was failing. From
out of the ground the darkness was rising again like a swelling
lake of still, black smoke, clinging about her feet with an awful
weight of recall.</p>

<p>She was sinking into the blackness, struggling against its
vast strength as it rose, sluggish and irresistible, to her waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
her breast, her neck. She could not fight its immense strength,
but her power had returned to her. They might be drowned
together in the darkness, but she would compel him to come
with her. She could see him no longer, but she was aware of
her limitless ability to hold him to her by the power of her
longing and her love....</p>

<p>She came slowly out of some remote distance to a realisation
of herself lying unaccountably still and dazed on her own
bed. She could not move, as yet, but her eyes were open, and
she could see the grey outline of the room in the growing daylight.</p>

<p>And then, again, clearly, but more distantly, she heard the
sound of Paul&#8217;s voice repeating his strange assertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dead,&#8221; he said, but in the tone there was now, she
thought, the first flicker of a doubt, the statement of wonder.</p>

<p>She made a great effort and raised herself.</p>

<p>He was sitting up in bed, propping his weakened body on
his tremulous arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not dead, Paul; you&#8217;re <i>not</i>, you&#8217;re <i>not</i>,&#8221; she screamed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you back, and I am going to hold you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment she was kneeling by him, supporting, clasping
him. Her power had become overwhelming, illimitable.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a grin, that was in some way sheepish,
a little ashamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m not, I jolly well ought to be,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It must have seemed to him so boastful to be alive again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">YOUNG STRICKLAND&#8217;S CAREER</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NO DOUBT the story of the future is written, so far as
the future is an expression of present potentialities. We
boast our foreknowledge of planetary history, and can prophesy
with fine accuracy the occurrence of every major and
minor eclipse or occultation in the solar system. But in the
most precise science there remains always at least one element
that is undefinable and unknowable. The regular traffic of
planets about the sun might one day be upset by the coming
of an unknown visitor from the deeps of space. The materials
of our knowledge are so limited. And in human affairs we know
so little of the materials. Nevertheless, it may be that to the
universal consciousness the future is a foretellable expression
of our present potentialities.</p>

<p>I remember how my friend Strickland used to harp on that
theme eighteen years ago. I was incredulous; a stickler for free-will.
I could not bear the thought of anything like a cut-and-dried
programme of human development. But my one really
convincing retort to all his arguments was to reply, &#8220;Oh; on
broad lines, perhaps. On the very broadest lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strickland&#8217;s attitude just then was so obviously influenced
by his desires. He had married at forty, had one child, a boy,
and was oppressed by the fear that he would not live to see his
son&#8217;s future. Strickland was obsessed with that idea for a time.
He even went so far as to consult mediums. And a man of forty-five
who will consult professional mediums about the future
cannot be quite sane.</p>

<p>His sole excuse for that lapse was the plea that astrology
had failed him. He had had two very expensive horoscopes cast,
and they had been most grievously at fault concerning the first
three years of little Strickland&#8217;s life. Both forecasts had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
gloomy with regard to those early years, prophesying a delicate
constitution, unusual trouble with infantile complaints. And
one horoscope shrugged its inspired shoulders at the critical
period of teething, and continued with a kind of cynical despair,
as if the astrologer were a little ashamed of the way he was
earning his ten guineas: &#8220;Should he, however, survive....&#8221;
And the truth was that little Strickland was quite a fatiguingly
healthy child. His appetite and his craving for exercise, even
at the age of eight weeks, were, admittedly, almost abnormal.</p>

<p>So Strickland lost faith in the pattern of the stars, and tried
mediums, who were not so nervous of the magistrates in those
days. If he had stuck to one clairvoyante he might have laid
his restless enquiry, but, unhappily, the first lady he visited
misread her client&#8217;s hopes, and mapped out a successful business
career for his little son; and Strickland, who had already
fulfilled that destiny in his own life, and had ambitions to see
his son leading a &#8220;really sensible Government,&#8221; took another
opinion. The second prophetess, pathetically anxious to please,
no doubt, saw young Strickland as a Bishop; the third was a
shade nearer to the mark with an Admiral; but the fourth&mdash;a
charming young woman, recently engaged to be married,
and collecting a trousseau by her last professional efforts&mdash;made
the boy a Poet.</p>

<p>After that Strickland bought a crystal, and tried to see the
future for himself.</p>

<p>I laughed at him then, of course; and even now I feel inclined
to laugh at those first foolish enquiries of his. But his
very earnestness should have saved Strickland from anything
like ridicule; and I am glad to remember that I did not laugh
when he told me of the one and only vision that came to him
through the crystal&mdash;it was, by the way, an unusually fine
specimen, as big as an orange. He picked it up second-hand,
somewhere in Soho.</p>

<p>As I see it, one of the most intriguing features of Strickland&#8217;s
experience is the fact that he had ceased to probe his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
son&#8217;s future when the vision came. The boy was seven years
old then, and had a little sister of two and a half who had partly
diverted her father&#8217;s attention. And Strickland had probably
outgrown the fear of his own premature death; though it may
be that his passionate longing for assurance as to the glory of
his boy&#8217;s career had not so much spent itself as been thrust back
into his sub-consciousness. Superficially the difference in him
was quite obvious. The change of his tone, for example, when
he spoke of his son. Even the manner of reference. The tender
enunciation of &#8220;My little boy&#8221; had altered to &#8220;That young
rascal of mine,&#8221; just the proudly modest description of the ordinary
father.</p>

<p>And when the vision came, neither he nor I related it in
any way to his ancient search....</p>

<p>He came to my rooms one evening after dinner, produced
the crystal from his pocket, and tossed it over to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;A present for a sceptic,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve finished with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I might have thought that he was clearing up the lumber
of his old fancies if it had not been for his manner; but the garment
of his initiation still clung to him and affected me with
the strangeness of its mystery.</p>

<p>I shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! don&#8217;t say you believe in it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;after all your
jeers at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see anything?&#8221; I insisted, nursing the crystal in
the cave of my two hands. I stared into it and saw the faint
pink of my magnified palm. No vision came to me; yet I was
aware of some potency in the thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps some reflection, some translation of one&#8217;s sub-consciousness....&#8221;
I ventured.</p>

<p>Strickland sneered. &#8220;By God, I hope not,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you&mdash;looking for?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;For nothing. I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
picked the thing up by the merest accident. I was going to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
it to the little girl&mdash;as a plaything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then....&#8221; I prompted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a picture in it. It snatched my attention. I wasn&#8217;t
thinking....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the picture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell. Just hell. The real thing; none of your picturesque
flames and torture. It came out at me, as it were, and it was&mdash;well,
the abomination of desolation, nothing more nor less
than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But....&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>He interrupted me. His eyes were fixed on the vision of a
future that had become a fragment of his past. &#8220;A waste,&#8221; he
said, in a low, thoughtful voice. &#8220;A dead, horrible waste ...
all black and pitted and furrowed ... it looked as if there had
been some awful, blasting eruption ... or as if the whole earth
had been scorched and blighted by some unimaginably vast fire.
But, oh! the terrible gauntness and death of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and threw his head back with a queer laugh
before he continued in a new tone, &#8220;It was just a silly nightmare,
that&#8217;s all. And it had its inevitable element of the grotesque.
In the middle of that waste there was a scarecrow, a
live scarecrow&mdash;digging. Digging turnips, if you please. Oh!
it was bosh, of course, absolute bosh. I shall have forgotten all
about it next week. But I couldn&#8217;t give the crystal to the little
girl after that. You can keep it. Tell me if you get anything....&#8221;</p>

<p>So I kept the crystal, and sometimes stared into it. But no
vision came to me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in the late autumn of 1919 that Strickland got permission
to go out to France. The war had made an old man
of him, although he was little over sixty; and he begged me to
go with him. &#8220;I should like you to help me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have
a feeling that we might, perhaps, hear something about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
young rascal of mine. &#8216;Wounded and missing,&#8217; you know, always
leaves one with just a hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first beautiful release of peace was passing then into
that restless craving for immense action which affected us all
so strongly at that time; and the feeling was aggravated in my
case by the realisation of impotence. I was too old to help.</p>

<p>I accepted Strickland&#8217;s offer, eagerly....</p>

<p>I do not believe that he remembered his vision when, after
a week&#8217;s fruitless enquiry, we came one afternoon to the historic
desert that had once been beautiful France. Certainly,
he made no reference to his old experience; but he was almost
senile. I noticed a difference in him, even in that one week.</p>

<p>But <i>I</i> remembered; and I had a fit of cold shivering that I
could not control when we came out on to the awful plain that
they now call The Plain of the Dead, and saw the figure of
that one demented peasant, dressed in the grotesque relics of
two nations&#8217; uniforms.</p>

<p>He was digging feverishly with his pointed spade, and I
heard the ring of it as it struck.</p>

<p>It was not a turnip that he wrenched up.</p>

<p>The thing rolled towards us....</p>

<p>Young Strickland&#8217;s head had always been a queer shape.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">A DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERAMENT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE differences between &#8220;young&#8221; Royce and &#8220;old&#8221; Bunnett
had a dramatic quality that stirred even the wearied indifference
of Stamp and Co.&#8217;s counting-house to simple efforts
in psychological analysis.</p>

<p>Young Royce was dark, square, and determined; a reasoned
boaster, who verified his boasts by action. When he made
what sounded like a very rash assertion, it was bad policy to
contradict, and quite fatal to bet against him.</p>

<p>Old Bunnett was tall and thin, fair, drooping, and despondent.
He seldom committed himself to a confident statement
of opinion, but gravely, almost voluptuously, hoped for the
worst on every possible occasion. He was, by the office&#8217;s classification,
of the same breed as &#8220;old Robinson,&#8221; who had come
into the firm as a boy of fourteen and had now served his employers
faithfully for fifty-one years.</p>

<p>Royce found a delight in marking that likeness. &#8220;Bunny,
my boy,&#8221; he used to say, &#8220;you&#8217;ve come here to stop. When I
come back here in twenty years&#8217; time I shall find you still at
the same old grind. You&#8217;ll never get out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so sure as I want to,&#8221; was Bunny&#8217;s single form of
defence against this impeachment of his powers of initiative&mdash;that
and a sniff. The sniff was his characteristic comment on
life; a long and thoughtful substitute for speech. He was not
more than ordinarily susceptible to colds in the head; and his
sniff was less a physical function than a vehicle of mental expression.</p>

<p>Young Royce, however, wanted and meant to leave the
firm &#8220;directly he could see his way,&#8221; as he put it. He had a
vein of prudence, or it may have been merely shrewdness, that
was sometimes overlooked by those who had come a little to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
dread the threat of his boasting. The one consolation afforded
to those who suffered under his implication of their feebleness
was the reflection that he would almost certainly &#8220;go to the
bad one of these days.&#8221; Bunny, alone, was pessimist enough
to admit that Royce would &#8220;get on.&#8221; He had been known to
add, &#8220;Sure to; he&#8217;s the sort that gets on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The office as a whole jealously disagreed with him; and
in their vehement denouncement of Bunny&#8217;s pessimism failed
to recognise that underlying all the violent and obvious contrasts
between Royce and Bunnett there was at least one point
of likeness, inasmuch as they both believed in Royce. (The
only likeness conceded by the office was the coincidence that
both men were born in the same month of the same year, and
had come into the firm of Stamp and Company on the same
day.)</p>

<p>Royce had actually left the firm on the Saturday afternoon
that first introduced him to Bunnett&#8217;s mother on Hampstead
Heath. He had &#8220;seen his way&#8221; as far as a job at Capetown&mdash;a
very risky and uncertain affair, in the office&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>He had a streak of romantic sentiment hidden away somewhere,
and he had come up to the Spaniards&#8217; Road to &#8220;take a
last look at London.&#8221; He was leaning over the railings looking
down across the Vale of Health, when he became aware of an
arrested Bunnett sniffing profoundly at the back of a bath-chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother,&#8221; Bunnett said, by way of introduction, and
then in a half-aside, &#8220;she&#8217;s a bit of an invalid, but she&#8217;s been a
little better lately, ain&#8217;t you, mother? This is the Mr. Royce
I was telling you about. Just going out to South Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunnett pinched her mouth into a line of sympathetic
disapproval. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long way to go,&#8221; she remarked&mdash;and
sniffed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>She and her son were, Royce thought, as exactly alike as
a couple of old sheep.</p>

<p>The job in Capetown proved even more uncertain than
the office had hopefully predicted, and Royce presently migrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to Melbourne. Thence he drifted across to Hobart. A
year later he had found a temporary post in Ceylon, then
worked his way up the Bay of Bengal to Calcutta, and stayed
there a month before he took ship to Tientsin. It was in 1909,
seven years after he had left London, that he first put foot in
America, landing at San Francisco, after crossing the Pacific
from Yokohama by way of Hawaii.</p>

<p>In those seven years he had suffered and learnt many things,
but if the staff of Stamp and Co.&#8217;s counting-house had met
&#8220;young Royce&#8221; on his landing in California they would have
found no difference in him. He came ashore with the boast
that he meant to make money in America.</p>

<p>And, indeed, his apparent failure to win any financial
success during those years of wandering was due rather to that
streak of imaginative romance in him than to any weakness of
character. It had been necessary for him to satisfy some lust
for adventure and experience before he could settle down to
achieve a worldly ambition. He knew himself well enough to
recognise his own quality. He had a perfect confidence in his
ability to make money eventually. And just as he had made
good his boasts in the old days, so now he made good his determination
to seek another form of romance in America.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to trace the means of his ascent.
He was so obviously the successful type that readily finds employment
and opportunity in the United States. He had determination
combined with initiative and imagination. It is
doubtful if even the deliberate, conservative methods of Stamp
and Co. could have overlooked his ability if he had elected to
stay in the employ of that stately English concern.</p>

<p>He became an American citizen in 1913, but he did not
revisit London until the autumn of 1917, when he came over
on business as a representative of the Steel Trust. Arthur H.
Royce had become a person of considerable importance and
influence. He stayed at the Carlton Hotel during the progress
of his negotiations with the English Government Department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the methods of which he ridiculed as being founded on the
same principles as those familiar to him in the counting-house
of Messrs. Stamp and Co.</p>

<p>But the old streak of romance showed itself again on the
last Saturday of his stay in England. He had not called on the
partners or employees of his old office. He had come to boast
in action now, and the boast of language had become futile
and unnecessary. He went up to the Spaniards&#8217; Road solely
to satisfy some need for self-approval that he hoped to find in
the contrast between his present condition and that in which
he had last looked down over the hazy prospect of London,
fifteen years before.</p>

<p>He was leaning over the rail in much the same place and
attitude when he saw, with a strange thrill, the once familiar
figure of old Bunnett coming towards him, pushing his invalid
mother in what was surely the same bath-chair.</p>

<p>Royce straightened himself, and turned to meet them. He
wondered if they would recognise him. There was something
of the old self-conscious boast in his attitude as he held out his
hand and said;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! Bunny. Still here, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunnett and his mother sniffed in concert, a deep and
melancholy comment on life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still here,&#8221; agreed Bunnett, and his mother added, &#8220;So
you&#8217;re back in London, Mr. Royce?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a few days,&#8221; Royce admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;South African job turn out all right?&#8221; Bunnett asked.</p>

<p>Royce hesitated. In one swift flash of retrospect he looked
back on those full and varied adventures that had begun for
him with the voyage to Capetown, and knew that though he
stood there talking and boasting for a week, he could not convey
to old Bunnett and his mother one-hundredth part of the
romance and wonder that had glorified his existence for fifteen
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes; all right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and you? Still with Stamps?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>And Bunnett, too, hesitated as if there were something he
also lacked power to describe before he answered &#8220;Yes, still
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation seemed to offer no further possibilities.
For a moment they stood awkwardly, and then Bunnett said,
&#8220;My mother&#8217;s a bit of an invalid, but she&#8217;s been a little better
lately.&#8221; He sniffed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>As Royce made his way back to his hotel he modestly
thanked God that he was not as some other men.</p>

<p>He had, however, missed one small observation. He had
been standing on Bunnett&#8217;s right side as they talked, and had
not noticed that he had lost his left arm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">REFERENCE WANTED!</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS USUAL, the compartment was nearly empty after we
left Rickmansworth, and I anticipated that my one other
fellow-passenger would probably get out at the next station
and leave me to finish the dull journey alone. I did not, in any
case, expect much entertainment from his society. He had a
narrow forehead, and a preoccupied, rather scared, expression.
It crossed my mind that he might have been a sufferer from
shell-shock. I had seen that look in the eyes of one such case,
a look at once timid, defensive, and suspicious. I was surprised
when he came across the compartment to the seat opposite to
me and began to talk.</p>

<p>We opened in the usual way by abusing the line, but he
broke off in the middle to comment on the book I had been
reading, Dostoievsky&#8217;s <i>The Possessed</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine stuff, that,&#8221; he commented, looked at me suspiciously
for a moment, and then added, &#8220;What&#8217;s that other book
of his, Anna&mdash;something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna Karenin?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s Tolstoi,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;I&#8217;ve no memory for some
things. No memory at all. But I&#8217;ve read more than you might
expect. To be quite honest, when I was a bit younger I read
too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears. I saw the promise of getting him to
talk about himself. And I can listen to anything a man has to
tell me of his own history; it is only men&#8217;s opinions that I find
so boring. Why will people have opinions?</p>

<p>&#8220;And overstrained your memory?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head and pursed his mouth. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that ruined my prospects,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; I commented, as provocatively as I could.</p>

<p>He leaned a little forward and frowned with an effect of
thoughtful concentration as he said, &#8220;You see, in some ways
I&#8217;ve got too good a memory; the trouble with me is that I can&#8217;t
remember what I&#8217;ve remembered.&#8221;</p>

<p>I raised my eyebrows interrogatively. I could see that he
was warm, now, with the craving to confess himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t a writer, yourself, by any chance?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a certain amount,&#8221; I admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought you had rather that look,&#8221; he said; and went
on quickly as if he were afraid that I might, in the circumstances,
be tempted to detail my own achievements; &#8220;and that
being so, my case might interest you, professionally, as you
might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly would, if you care to....&#8221; I began, but I
saw that he was not listening. Those queer-looking eyes of
his had taken on the expression of one who is engaged in some
immense effort of memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a young man,&#8221; he said&mdash;I guessed him to be, then,
about thirty-five&mdash;&#8220;I had a great ambition to become a writer;
but although my mind was full of ideas, I had no gift for putting
them into language. At first, I tried in the ordinary way,
just as all beginners do, to write stories for the magazines; but
they none of them got accepted. Which wasn&#8217;t to be wondered
at. I knew myself how bad they were, and I used to console
myself a little with that knowledge. I may have read somewhere
that so long as you kept a cool head about your own
writing, there was hope for you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, I left off writing for a time&mdash;I wasn&#8217;t twenty
then&mdash;and took to studying. I read all the best authors&mdash;carefully,
trying to see how the thing was done. I had a lot of
spare time one way and another, and in the next five years I
got through a wonderful lot of reading. I didn&#8217;t confine myself
to English authors, either; I read a heap of translations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Russian, French, and German. And all that time I never once
tried to write again, myself. I was just getting to learn my
trade, I thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I lost my job in the city, and while I was looking
about for another one I had another shot at writing a magazine
story. Well, it was certainly the nearest I&#8217;d got up to then of
being the right thing. It was a lot better written than any of
my other shots, but the plot was too weak. And I found that
in learning to write I had lost all my ideas. I&#8217;d forgotten all
the old ones, and no new ones came to me. At least, not at
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment and looked out of the window before
he continued, rather abruptly: &#8220;An idea came to me, though,
in the train one day&mdash;the best I&#8217;d ever had. And I not only
saw the whole story clear in my mind, but I saw just how it
ought to be written. I went home and began it at once. I had
it finished in two days. A little masterpiece I thought it was.
I submitted it to one of the reviews, and it was accepted within
a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fortnight later I&#8217;d written another. It was very different
from the first&mdash;done in another mood, as you might say,
and lighter altogether. But that one came, too, as an inspiration,
and was accepted by one of the magazines. And, after
that, I used to get inspirations every other day almost&mdash;all
sorts of inspirations. I saw myself as the most versatile and
gifted writer of the day. I fancied that when my stories were
collected and published in book form they would cause a lot
of attention. By the time my second story appeared in the
magazine&mdash;that was the first to get into print&mdash;I had written
about eight altogether, and they&#8217;d all been taken by some editor
or another&mdash;except one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused again, and remained silent for so long that I
prompted him by saying: &#8220;What was the matter with that
one exception?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me and sighed. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wrong with the story, as you might say,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but there
was a note from the editor in which he said that my story appeared
to be a translation from some French writer, I&#8217;ve forgotten
the name, and should not have been submitted as an
original contribution. Rather a nasty note it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;And about a week later my first story came out in the
review, and then there was the devil to pay. It seems that that
was a translation, too, from the Russian, and had been printed
in English, in a collection of the fellow&#8217;s works. His name
began with a T, too, I fancy, but it wasn&#8217;t Tolstoi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turgenev?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; he said wearily. &#8220;<i>I</i> can&#8217;t remember. All
I know is that every one of my stories were cribs. I&#8217;d remembered
them all, and didn&#8217;t remember that I&#8217;d remembered.
Well, I got back all the stories that hadn&#8217;t been published, but
there was the very deuce of a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train was drawing into Aylesbury, and my companion
got up and collected his things from the rack. Before he got
out, however, he paused to say, &#8220;Well, there you are. It was
a dreadful experience for me, but if you can make any use of
it, professionally, so to speak, you&#8217;re welcome to it. Good-day
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had still four more stations to go, and I sat on, turning
over that strange confession in my mind. The man had appeared
to be honest, the story sounded true as he told it, yet his
phraseology and his accent were not those I should have expected
from one of his literary experience.</p>

<p>But what worries me most of all is the vague but horribly
persistent impression that somewhere, at some time, I have
seen that story of his in print....</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">AS THE CROW FLIES</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT IS more than twenty years, now, since the late George
Wallace came into the offices of Hallows and Rice one
afternoon and talked to me about the novel he was writing.
He was well known, even then, as journalist, essayist, playwright,
and poet, and I welcomed with enthusiasm the suggestion
that the firm of publishers for which I was then reader
should consider the book when it was written. He told me in
the strictest confidence that the title was to be <i>As the Crow
Flies</i>, and gave me a hint of the subject he proposed to treat.
Both title and subject were, I thought, admirable from every
point of view, but he said that he would prefer me to say nothing
to the firm about the novel until it was actually written.
&#8220;Wait until you&#8217;ve read it, my dear chap,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
told another soul as yet, and I don&#8217;t want to, until the thing&#8217;s
done and off my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not see him again for nearly six months. He was the
guest of the evening at a small literary dining club on that
occasion, and when I went over and sat down by him, after
the speeches, he instantly referred to our last interview by saying,
&#8220;It&#8217;s getting on, but we can&#8217;t talk about it here. How&#8217;s
the business?&#8221; I told him that the business, so far as I was
concerned, remained in a state of tense expectation for a really
firstclass novel. He nodded with an air of satisfaction. &#8220;You
shall have it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll walk part of the way home
with me I&#8217;ll tell you something about it.&#8221; He lived at Highgate,
and my rooms were at Herne Hill, but I was prepared to miss
the last train rather than lose that confidence. I was very eager
in those days.</p>

<p>And I certainly did not regret the walk to Highgate and
back, nor the two hours&#8217; wait at Ludgate Hill for the 3.15<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
&#8220;paper&#8221; train. Wallace let himself go that night, and made me
realise that his novel was to be the best thing for years. He told
me all about it. The book was to be a complete exposition of
the British national character, as portrayed in the person of his
hero, Joseph Blake. Blake was to be a success; a typical member
of the middle class, educated at a grammar school, entering
a business career at eighteen, and Parliament at forty-five;
achieving cabinet rank at fifty-four, and the Premiership at
sixty-three. As a background to the central figure there were
to be any number of minor characters, all, as it were, supporting
and representing Blake&mdash;&#8220;the firm mass of British opinion&#8221;
Wallace called it. The single exception was to be a school
friend of Blake&#8217;s, a man of brilliant parts, but without social or
personal ambitions, who spent his life in writing works of
philosophy that nobody wanted to read. He was not poor, nor,
in a sense, neglected&mdash;&#8220;we&#8217;ll get away altogether from the
typical romance,&#8221; Wallace commented&mdash;but his work and
life counted for nothing in popular opinion. The real climax
of the book, and incidentally the very first suggestion that
Blake was not a great man nor his friend (&#8220;I have thought of
calling him John Rooke,&#8221; Wallace said) a failure, was reached
in the last few pages, when Blake, after a prolonged illness,
and patiently waiting for death, confides in Rooke that he
knows, now, that such a career as his had been was wasted
effort. To which Rooke replies that he had known that at
school.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much of the book have you written?&#8221; I asked Wallace
just before we parted.</p>

<p>&#8220;About 80,000 words,&#8221; he told me, &#8220;but I am not absolutely
satisfied with some of the detail. What I propose to do
is to finish the thing and then partly rewrite it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to America on a long lecture-tour that autumn,
and I did not see him again for twelve months. I sought him
out, then, because McGillett made a casual reference to the
magnum opus at lunch one day, and I realised that I was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
longer the only recipient of Wallace&#8217;s confidence. In those
days one of McGillett&#8217;s sources of income was finding books
for publishers, and afterwards using what influence he had to
get his discoveries well noticed in the Press; and when I found
that he knew about the book, I was afraid that I might not,
after all, get it for Hallows and Rice.</p>

<p>Wallace reassured me, however. He said that he never
went back on a bargain, and when I pointed out to him that
no bargain had been made as yet, he promised to call at the
office next day and discuss terms with the partners. On my
recommendation, the terms offered were amazingly liberal for
a first novel; but my enthusiasm was powerful enough for once
to overcome the awful inertia of old Hallows. (He had been
in the publishing business for thirty years, and his one idea was
to buy as cheaply as he could. He had no conception of what
Rice and myself understood by &#8220;enterprise.&#8221;) The firm even
went so far as to offer to pay a proportion of the &#8220;advance&#8221; on
signing the agreement, but Wallace refused to accept that. He
said that it would harass him to feel tied; and he would not
promise any particular date for the delivery of the manuscript.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve nearly finished the book,&#8221; he told us, &#8220;but when it&#8217;s
written, I want to put it away for three months and then go
right through it again with a fresh mind. I mean this book to
be a classic.&#8221; Old Hallows was tremendously impressed, I
remember, and congratulated me on having made &#8220;a real find.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that agreement was signed I no longer felt it necessary
to hold my tongue about the book, and I dropped a hint
or two here and there as to what might be expected when it
was published. I cannot believe, however, that I was the chief
instigator of the steadily growing interest that was being aroused
by the promise of Wallace&#8217;s novel. No doubt both old Hallows
and Rice made occasional references in public to the same subject,
but I fancy that Wallace himself was the really active
propagandist. In any case, one was continually finding references
to <i>As the Crow Flies</i> in the Press that spring, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
name of Joseph Blake was sometimes referred to as an exemplar
of the British character. The book was asked for at the
libraries, and I more than once met people who declared that
they had read it. At the office we had decided to print a first
edition of 20,000 copies, and we put a note about it in our
autumn list. Wallace assured me that summer (1899) that the
thing was done and only needed a final revision. &#8220;If I died
tomorrow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the story is all there ready to be published,
but there is an incident or two that I want to alter before I send
it along to you. I mean to deliver you a perfect manuscript. I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t touch the thing in proof.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, of course, we did not press him for delivery in
the autumn of that year. We should not, in any case, have
published so important a book during the first months of the
Boer war. And in the following spring Wallace himself went
out to South Africa. I did not see him before he went. In fact,
I did not know he had enlisted until I saw a reference to the
fact in the &#8220;literary notes&#8221; that were just beginning to break
out again in the daily and weekly papers.</p>

<p>In that paragraph Wallace&#8217;s name was, as usual, coupled
with that of his novel <i>As the Crow Flies</i>, a precedent that was
invariably followed two months later in his obituary notices.
(It will be remembered that he died of enteric in June 1900.)
Many of the writers assumed that the book had already been
published, but some of the better informed expressed their
eagerness to read the book which they understood had been
completed before Wallace went out to the front.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that our failure to discover that precious
manuscript of Wallace&#8217;s was the cause of old Hallows&#8217;s breakdown
and subsequent retirement from the business. He used
to go up to Highgate two or three days a week to search Wallace&#8217;s
house for possible hiding places. &#8220;He would have been
sure to have put it in some very safe place before he left the
country,&#8221; he would say, and then fret himself into a fever
lamenting the &#8220;rank imbecility&#8221; of not having insisted on taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
charge of the precious script before Wallace went away.</p>

<p>Rice&#8217;s theory was that Wallace had taken the MS. with
him to make his final revision, but I have often wondered whether
Wallace had ever begun it. I have found a suggestion of
that one fatal omission, in his title. He took too direct a method.
So far as he was concerned, the book was written, and published,
and noticed, without his having put pen to paper.</p>

<p>But the queer thing is that the unwritten book has outlived
him. For some reason it was not forgotten in the stress of the
South African war. And it will be remembered that, in the
reaction of the first years of this century, <i>As the Crow Flies</i> was
constantly &#8220;quoted,&#8221; and that there was quite a controversy as
to whether the figure of Joseph Blake did not stand for that of
Joseph Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Indeed, I was tempted to put down these notes of the true
facts of the case because a friend asked me yesterday where he
could get a book called <i>As the Crow Flies</i>, by George Wallace.
A man had told him, he said, that it was the finest novel of the
century.</p>

<h2 class="nobreakleft">THE NIGHT OF CREATION</h2>

<h3 class="nobreakleft">PART 1: THE DISCUSSION</h3></div>


<h4>1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">THE DISCUSSION had threatened while they were still
at dinner. Leslie Vernon had begun it: and there had
been a hardness and a determination in his expression that had
sharpened the suggestion of fanaticism in his clever face. Little
Harrison, already looking a trifle flushed and dishevelled, had
only managed to avoid the direct issue by talking rapidly, and
with something more than his usual brilliance, about the true
inwardness of the Russian Revolution; a subject upon which
he had recently acquired some very special information. Even
Lady Ulrica More, who was manifestly prepared to encourage
Vernon, had been borne down and fairly talked into silence.</p>

<p>The other guests of the week-end party, although they
had shown no signs of disapproving Vernon&#8217;s choice of topic
when he had irrelevantly introduced it, had accepted their cue
with a tactful readiness. Little Harrison was their host, and if
he wished, as he obviously did, to avoid this topic of Psychical
Research, it was their duty to support him. Moreover, Mrs.
Harrison had cut in almost at once, with that bird-like flustered
air of hers, to the effect that spiritualism was almost &#8220;worse
than religion with some people&#8221; and never led to anything but
recriminations. Vernon had smiled with a fine effect of self-control
when she had said that, but before he could defend
himself, Harrison at the other end of the table had got under
way with an anecdote of Lenin&#8217;s pre-revolution career in Switzerland.</p>

<p>And directly dinner was finished, he had suggested that
they should take their coffee and liqueurs on the lawn under
the cedar. There was excuse enough&mdash;it was a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
night&mdash;but Greatorex, the leader-writer, who had acquired a
habit of always looking for secret motives, was probably right
in calling the move to the garden &#8220;a clever dodge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dodge?&#8221; enquired young Fell listlessly. He had sat
through dinner with a melancholy air of wondering how people
could be interested in spirits whether of the dead or of the Russians;
but Greatorex had been too much engrossed in drawing
his own inferences to take any notice of Fell&#8217;s distraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; he said, taking Fell&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Gives Harrison the
chance of slipping off when he can&#8217;t stand it any longer. In a
room, it&#8217;s a bit pointed to get up and go away, but out here
Vernon&#8217;ll probably find himself addressing Harrison&#8217;s empty
chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fell sighed. &#8220;What&#8217;s he want&mdash;Vernon, I mean?&#8221; he
asked indifferently.</p>

<p>Greatorex was willing enough to explain. &#8220;He wants to
bring Harrison to book,&#8221; he said, leading his companion down
towards the sunk fence out of earshot of the rest of the party.
&#8220;You see, Vernon has been tremendously interested in that
book of Schrenck-Notsing&#8217;s. You&#8217;ve seen it, I expect? It&#8217;s
all about materialisations. Extraordinary stuff. They did get
amazing results. The book&#8217;s full of photographs of the materialisations.
Licked Crookes&#8217;s <i>Katie King</i> into a cocked hat.
Well, Vernon&#8217;s been writing about it all over the place. Says
it proves that there is a form of matter unknown to science, and
that until the sceptics have disproved that, they had better shut
up about the problem of immortality and so on. And then Harrison
came out with a leader in the Supplement, pooh-poohing
the whole affair. Clever stuff, of course, but not very sound on
the logical side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Vernon wants to pin him down, I suppose?&#8221; Fell
commented tepidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to have a straight argument,&#8221; Greatorex said,
and then sinking his voice to a confidential note, he continued,
&#8220;And if you ask me, Fell, Harrison&#8217;s <i>afraid</i> of spiritualism. I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
seen him tackled before, and he loses his temper. He doesn&#8217;t
want to listen! You know the look that comes into a fellow&#8217;s
face when he&#8217;s shutting his mind against you&mdash;a sort of resolution
and concentration as if he&#8217;d got his eye on his own ideal
somewhere in the middle distance, and did not mean to look
away from it....&#8221; He paused in the very heart of his account
of Harrison&#8217;s perversity, suddenly struck by the application of
his description to the present expression on Fell&#8217;s face. &#8220;Pretty
much the look you&#8217;re wearing now, in fact,&#8221; he concluded
drily. &#8220;Sorry if I&#8217;ve been boring you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fell came back to a realisation of his lapse with a slight
start. &#8220;No, no, rather not, Greatorex,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean it
wasn&#8217;t that; the truth is I&#8217;m rather worried. I was thinking....&#8221;
He waved his hand vaguely in the direction of the sunset,
and added, &#8220;That, somehow, made me feel as if....&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatorex thrust his hands into the pockets of his dinner-jacket
and turned round to observe the phenomenon that had
distracted Fell&#8217;s attention. For a moment his prominent nose
and rather small head came out as an emphatic silhouette against
the afterglow in the North-West; and to Fell, already deep
in the languors of sentiment, presented an air of picturesque
romance.</p>

<p>Since Fell had come out from the high-lights and conventional
influences of the house, his determination had begun to
give way. In the atmosphere of the dining-room, he had felt
certain that he would be right in doing what he had come down
here expressly to do. Phyllis was no wife for a Civil Servant in
his position. He had seen the consequences of such marriages
in the Service. They kept a man back. If he married her, he
would lose just that extra fillip of influence which would make
the difference between special appointments and the common
routine of promotion that would leave him no better prospect
than an ultimate income of at best ten or twelve hundred
pounds a year. One could not expect Lady Ulrica, for example,
to continue the patronage she seemed, at present, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
willing to lend him, if he made a marriage of that kind. He
had seen it all so clearly while they were at dinner, and although
his heart had failed him at the thought of his coming
interview with Phyllis&mdash;she was so sweet and so gentle and
she loved him with such an amazing singleness and rapture&mdash;he
had been sure that he must give her up before his honour
was entangled.</p>

<p>But now all the prestige of social success, everything that
was represented by the fashion he had just left, was dwindling
and fading; the effect of it falling away so that it seemed to him
garish and unreal&mdash;as the lights and distractions of the town
may seem to a man who sets his face eagerly towards the joy
of his quiet home. The rest and immensity of nature was an
enduring reality with which his love was in perfect accord.
He and Phyllis had their place in it. If he could step down,
now, to the sombre yews at the lake&#8217;s edge and take her in his
arms, as he had done a month ago, his last doubts would vanish
on the instant. They would be one with the greatness of earth,
and able to look down with contempt from their perfect enthronement,
at the frivolous and ephemeral superficiality of
conventional life....</p>

<p>The sound of Greatorex&#8217;s voice seemed to take up the
thread of his dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course, you&#8217;re a poet, Fell,&#8221; Greatorex said. &#8220;You feel
an evening like this, I suppose? Means something quite tremendous
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Fell began, trembling on the verge of confession;
&#8220;there is a reason why, more particularly, to-night....&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatorex turned round and looked at him. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry afterwards. Better not tell me. I
know I look romantic, but I&#8217;m not. Harrison says I ought to
have been a pirate. He&#8217;s wrong, I ought to have been a barrister.
I&#8217;ll tell you, now, just what I&#8217;ve been thinking while I&#8217;ve
been looking at all this view that makes you feel so sentimental.
I&#8217;ve been thinking that I wouldn&#8217;t like to have a lake so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
near the house&mdash;unhealthy. And I don&#8217;t care for all those
black yews, either. Melancholy, mournful, things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fell shuddered. &#8220;They <i>are</i> mournful,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;but
they&#8217;re in keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much,&#8221; Greatorex said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s
your sentimental influence or not, Fell; but, damn it, this place
makes <i>me</i> feel superstitious, to-night. It&#8217;s so infernally quiet
and brooding, as if it were hatching some nasty mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or some wonderful miracle?&#8221; Fell suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;We probably mean the same thing,&#8221; Greatorex said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a trick of using prose words to get attention. &#8216;Wonderful
miracle,&#8217; you know, would be either a clich or bombast in
a leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fell did not appear to hear this explanation. He was looking
out over the swell of Orton Park that was separated from
Harrison&#8217;s garden by the width of the lake. The afterglow
was slowly dying and the greens of turf and wood were deepening
and hardening into dark masses little softer than the
funereal shadows of the clustered yews. The detail that had
recently started into almost excessive prominence under the
level light of the setting sun, was taking refuge in the temporary
darkness before it emerged again altered in shape and colour
to greet the mysteries of the moon. Only the lake still shone
faintly, reflecting a last glimmer of brightness in the Northern
sky. Near the island, a streamer of indigo ripples splayed out
to mark the course of some belated water-bird, hurrying back
to the cover of the reeds; and in the hush of the coming night
Fell could almost believe that he heard the delicate clash and
whisper of infinitely tiny waves breaking in hasty processional
upon the sandy foreshore.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Straordinarily peaceful,&#8221; murmured Greatorex. &#8220;Suppose
we ought to be joining the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose we ought,&#8221; Fell agreed tamely. What else
was there to do? He could not go down to the village of Long
Orton now, and beseech Phyllis to come out and walk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
him by the lake. And without her, all the glory of this amazing
night was wasted.</p>

<p>Nor was the full promise of the night yet revealed to him;
for it was not until with a reluctant sigh he had turned to follow
Greatorex back to the nearly invisible group under the
cedar, that he saw the Hunter&#8217;s moon, a great disc of ruddy
copper, resting as it seemed on the very edge of the eastern
horizon.</p>

<p>He lingered, gazing, for a few seconds, half resolved even
now to escape the banalities of polite conversation on the lawn
and go up to the village. This was such a rare night for the
silences of love; serene, brooding and mystical. Yet the automaton
in him, the formalised, cultured habit of the Civil Servant,
moved him relentlessly back towards the decencies of
polite society and the patronage of Lady Ulrica More.</p>

<p>As he silently approached the group on the lawn he heard
the clear, musical voice of Leslie Vernon.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least you might let one state a case, Harrison,&#8221; he was
saying.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>They had already passed the stage of skirmishing for position,
when Greatorex rejoined them. Something had apparently
happened to Harrison since he came out into the garden.
He had lost that effect of impatience which had underlain all
his talk of Russia, when, as though afraid of silence, he had
been talking, a trifle desperately, against some latent opposition.</p>

<p>Now, comfortably relaxed in the depth of a well-designed
basket chair, and little more of him visible than the gleam of
his shirt front, the pale blur of his face and the occasional glow
of his cigarette end, he had an air of being tolerantly complacent.
It seemed that he was willing to listen, however condescendingly,
to Vernon&#8217;s attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Harrison,&#8221; Vernon had begun. &#8220;Why won&#8217;t
you talk this out?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;Nothing fresh to say,&#8221; Harrison had replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>I</i> have,&#8221; Vernon continued; and then Lady Ulrica
definitely put her weight into the scale by saying, &#8220;How fascinating!
Something really new in the way of evidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or only a rchauff?&#8221; Harrison interpolated.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least you might let one state a case,&#8221; Vernon said as
Greatorex joined the other four and sat down with a grunt
beside his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;We saw you gesticulating picturesquely against the sunset,
G.,&#8221; Harrison remarked, as though he would even now
create a diversion and defer the discussion indefinitely.</p>

<p>Greatorex snorted; quite conscious of the fact that in Harrison&#8217;s
presence he always played up in manner to that part
of the buccaneer which had been thrust upon him, although
he disclaimed it in speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been discussing the effects of sunset on temperament,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But did you see the <i>Moon</i>?&#8221; asked Mrs. Harrison, rather
in the tone of one who introduces a delightful piece of scandal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid I missed that,&#8221; Greatorex said. &#8220;But I expect Fell
has found it. He&#8217;s probably worshipping now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but you ought,&#8221; Mrs. Harrison asserted, still intent
no doubt, on keeping away from the subject of spiritualism,
for her husband&#8217;s sake. &#8220;It was like a rather badly done stage
moon balanced on the scenery. Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t we all go and worship
with Mr. Fell?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one moved, however; and the excuse of joining Fell
was spoilt by his arrival at the cedar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do help yourself to coffee and anything you want, Mr.
Fell,&#8221; Mrs. Harrison said. &#8220;If you can see, that is.&#8221; She was
certainly doing her best to keep the conversation at the right
after-dinner level. She was so far successful that for a minute
or two little spurts of irrelevant talk continued to start up and
die away again, like the uncertain catspaws of wind before a
flat calm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>It was Harrison himself who at last anticipated the inevitable.
He must have felt, as everyone had&mdash;including his
plucky but finally despairing wife&mdash;that it was inevitable.
There was something that urged them, something more than
that quiet determination of Vernon&#8217;s, although his very silence
conveyed a perpetual sense of remonstrance. But this other,
greater influence was with them as an almost palpable presence.
It was like a force exhausting them and drawing them into a
common focus.</p>

<p>None of them was more keenly aware of it than Fell,
though he attributed the weakness that was overcoming him
to a particular source. For here, with the arm of his chair almost
touching that of Lady Ulrica&#8217;s, he was planning an interview
with Phyllis that held no least hint of the renunciation
of love. He was giving way freely and without reserve to his
dream. Moreover, he had a curious sense of instant accomplishment,
as if at that very moment his spirit and the spirit
of Phyllis had touched and coalesced. He was drifting into far
heights of remote and supernal ecstasy, when the thin, high
voice of Harrison recalled him to earth; and he started as
though, on the verge of sleep, he had been brutally jarred and
awakened by the violent slamming of a door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! hm! Well, Vernon,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all
waiting for that statement of your case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vernon&#8217;s chair creaked slightly as if he had suddenly leaned
forward.</p>

<p>This moment of their beginning, when by some undivinable
act of common consent all oppositions had been temporarily
relinquished and they were agreed at least to listen, was,
also, the moment of greatest darkness. Presently the moon
transmuted from copper to brass would rise above the house
and give validity and form to all that was now being created
in the profundity of the night. But when Vernon began to
speak, he was hidden from them; they realised him only as a
voice, that issued with a steady and increasing definition out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the silence and the shadows.</p>

<p>He talked well, pleading without passion for an unprejudiced
examination of all the new &#8220;facts&#8221; in psychical research.
He had a scholarly knowledge of his subject and gave his instances
and authorities, building up as it seemed to Lady Ulrica,
to Fell, and even to Greatorex, a case that it would be very
hard to knock down.</p>

<p>Not once did Harrison interrupt him, and during Vernon&#8217;s
occasional pauses the immense stillness of the night seemed to
close in upon the little group under the cedar with a sudden
intensity. The slender stream of his steady speech was like a
little candle, burning delicately in the darkness, and when it
was extinguished, his listeners were freshly aware of themselves
and their surroundings. In those moments of almost painful
silence, they sought to recover their consciousness of the familiar
world by restless movements and faint articulations. Chairs
creaked, someone sighed, and once Greatorex rather brutally
coughed.</p>

<p>Nearly at the end of his long speech, however, Vernon&#8217;s
tone became more emotional. He was talking, then, of materialisations
and of the strange and as yet unrecognised form of
matter&mdash;provisionally known as the ectoplasm or teleplasm&mdash;that
issues from the body of the medium, is manifested in visible
forms that can be successfully photographed, and can handle
material objects.</p>

<p>&#8220;I claim that the existence of this matter is proved,&#8221; Vernon
concluded. &#8220;Given favourable conditions, the medium
can build up a form, visible, tangible, ponderable and capable
of simulating every appearance of material reality. I don&#8217;t say
that this amazing phenomenon proves the immortality of the
soul, but I do say that until you produce another hypothesis to
cover the immense accumulation of tested facts, you have no
right to pronounce any opinion in psychical research.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the moon, now pale as scoured brass, had
topped the trees behind the house, and was sending out pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and slender shafts of light to pierce here and there the overshadowing
gloom of the wide cedar: one shaft had dappled the
statuesque bare shoulder of Lady Ulrica, and another had slanted
down upon the smooth fair hair of Leslie Vernon. And by
such reflections and by other sources of faint diffusion, the
heavy brooding darkness that had so far enveloped the group
on the lawn, had been definitely lifted. Dimly they could see
each other, either as shadows against the increasing brightness
beyond, or as weakly illuminated figures picked out, maybe,
by a brilliant little spark of moonshine that had pierced its way
through some common opening in the many-storied foliage
above.</p>

<p>And although there had come no least stir of wind to break
the intense calm, the releasing effect of the light was manifest
upon the spirits of the party. As Vernon ceased speaking everyone
suddenly wanted to talk. A little fusillade of chatter broke
out, which only gave way when Greatorex was heard saying:
&#8220;If he believe not Stainton Moses and the Lodges, neither will
he believe though one rose from the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison laughed brightly. &#8220;We must remember
that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not a question of rising from the dead at all, Mr.
Greatorex,&#8221; Lady Ulrica put in. She had no sense of humour.</p>

<p>Vernon apparently felt that all the effect of his long argument
was being foolishly dissipated by this absurd interruption.
&#8220;Well, Harrison, what&#8217;s your answer to my case?&#8221; he asked
in a slightly raised voice.</p>

<p>Harrison began to stammer, a sure sign that his temper was
at last beginning to conquer him. &#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t see, even if we
admit the validity of these materialisations,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you&mdash;you
are any nearer to proving your general case, Vernon.
I&#8217;ve been into the whole question very thoroughly and&mdash;and
impartially, and I can only say that I see no reason whatever
to assume that we have ever received any communication from
the spirits of the dead. I think that that is the real point under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
discussion, and I can&#8217;t see that you&#8217;ve done much to support
your contention. What d&#8217;you say, G.?&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatorex grunted. A beam of moonlight had just caught
the most salient of his features, and at the moment his face appeared
to be all nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t accept my explanation of the facts, Harrison?&#8221;
Vernon persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t see why I should,&#8221; Harrison replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see the necessity for it. I&mdash;I&#8217;m not convinced, by any means,
of the validity of your examples. At present, I am content to
go on with the enquiry without formulating any theory. I contend
that the evidence up to the present time is insufficient to
theorise upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! well, there&#8217;s a lot more coming,&#8221; Vernon replied,
and for the first time a real note of passion crept into his voice.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you realise that all these developments taken together
are just the first stages of the knowledge that is coming to us?
They are symptoms, that&#8217;s all, of the new trend in the evolution
of mankind; of the coming of the new age&mdash;the age of the
Spirit. The days of materialism are nearly spent, and the next
generation will smile at our feeble tentatives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ask me how I know? Well, I can&#8217;t tell you in
terms that you can understand. The best part of my knowledge
is intuitional, but intuition, even mysticism, must no
longer be divorced from science and intellect. That, I feel, is
the essential synthesis of the new doctrine. We are going to
produce our material proofs; in the future religion and science
will become one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own opinion, precisely,&#8221; said Lady Ulrica.</p>

<p>But Vernon&#8217;s homily had proved a little too much for
Harrison. He tried to speak and could not control the pitch of
his voice, which soared ineffectively to a falsetto squeak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;I ...&#8221; he began, and had to get to his feet
before he could attain coherence. Then he started again with
&#8220;No, no! It&#8217;s incredible nonsense that&mdash;the kind of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
foreshadowed by spiritualism&mdash;could ever appeal to sensible
men and women. Are we to be expected to listen to the drivelling
platitudes of some supposed spirit communicating through
an illiterate old woman with the further interposition of a &#8216;control,&#8217;
speaking pigeon English and imitating the worst sophistications
of a spoilt child? No, no, positively I can&#8217;t take that
kind of nonsense seriously. I&mdash;I have no sort of desire to imitate
the credulity of Lodge, Barrett and Crookes&mdash;no sort of desire.
I&mdash;I&mdash;it&#8217;s absurd. I&#8217;ve no patience even to talk about it. Who
is coming to look at the moon?&#8221; And without waiting to receive
any response to his invitation, he turned his back on the
cedar and strode out, a perturbed and impatient little figure,
into the light of the open garden.</p>

<p>The other six followed him in a straggling procession.</p>

<p>Emma Harrison was obviously relieved that the discussion
was at an end. &#8220;I said it would only end in recriminations,&#8221;
she explained to Greatorex, who looked about seven feet high
in contrast with her diminutive slenderness. &#8220;Charles never
can keep his temper about that subject. And I did think it was
very splendid of him to keep it as long as he did. We can&#8217;t do
with all that nonsense. Can you, Mr. Greatorex?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison dropped her voice to an indiscreet confidence.
&#8220;I always think that our poor dear Lady Ulrica,&#8221; she
whispered, &#8220;is so very much the type from which mediums are
made. You know, stout, placid, and not too clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer thing why mediums should generally be so stupid,&#8221;
commented Greatorex, tactfully avoiding any overt
agreement with his hostess&#8217;s description of Lady Ulrica.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the party drifted about the lawn in
couples, with the exception of Harrison, who maintaining a
little distance from the others was pacing restlessly up and
down, either working off his spleen or thinking out some really
telling retort that should settle Vernon&#8217;s business once and for
all.</p>

<p>The moon was now high in the heavens, but it had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
another transmutation. A faint screen of misty cirrus had crept
over the sky, and the brass was toned down almost to the whiteness
of silver. And with this change, the light in the garden
had become more diffused. The shadows had lost their hardness,
the high-lights their accentuation.</p>

<p>And by degrees, some sense of a peculiar quality in the
night began to affect every member of the little party on the
lawn. They began by almost imperceptible changes in their
movements to drift together into a little knot, like the swimming
bubbles in a cup. The area of their promenade diminished
until even Harrison himself had come into the focus;
and yet when they had again drawn into a group they had
nothing to say to one another. It is true that they were still
conscious of a slight social constraint, due to what had amounted
to a quarrel between the host and one of his guests. But
there was something in their attitude and their common movement
towards each other that suggested some deeper cause for
their momentary awkwardness. It was as if each of them was
aware of some sudden fear, and hesitated to speak lest the
shameful fact should be revealed.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Harrison who first broke a silence that was
becoming altogether too insistent&mdash;even the soft hush of their
feet upon the grass had ceased. She laughed artificially, with
a touch as it seemed of bravado, a laugh that might have disguised
a shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it seems to you,&#8221; she said in a high
strained voice, &#8220;but it strikes me that it&#8217;s actually getting a little
chilly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. It is, Emma,&#8221; her husband replied with an effect
of relief. &#8220;I&mdash;I think we&#8217;d better go in. We get a cold air
off the lake, now and again,&#8221; he explained to the company at
large.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precious little air, Harrison,&#8221; muttered Greatorex. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never known a stiller night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haze come over the moon,&#8221; commented Fell, staring up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
into the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has certainly turned colder,&#8221; remarked Lady Ulrica
with a shiver; &#8220;much colder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison cleared his throat and made his usual effort to get
his pitch. &#8220;Hm! Hm! Perhaps we&#8217;re going to get some phenomena,&#8221;
he said with a slightly cracked laugh. &#8220;Always the
first warning, isn&#8217;t it, Vernon, a draught of cold air?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; Lady Ulrica said solemnly, before Vernon
could reply.</p>

<p>Harrison was about to speak again when Greatorex cut in.
&#8220;I say,&#8221; he said, in a voice that held a just perceptible note of
excitement, &#8220;is that one of your maids down there by the lake?
Girl in white; moving about by the yews?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you mean?&#8221; Mrs. Harrison replied, speaking
with a little flurry of haste. &#8220;It must be after eleven, and the
maids are in bed long ago, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone down there, anyway,&#8221; Greatorex asserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm, hm! G.&#8217;s quite right, my dear,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;I&mdash;I
think we ought to investigate this in the cause of common
morality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles? It may be one of the village girls,&#8221; his wife suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;In which case she has no business in our paddock at midnight,&#8221;
Harrison replied, and as he spoke he began to walk
with an air of mechanical determination towards the steps in
the sunk fence that led to the meadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we all go?&#8221; Greatorex asked, but Mrs. Harrison
manifestly hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Do you think, perhaps....&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>Greatorex, however, had not waited for her permission,
and in half a dozen strides he too had reached the meadow.
Vernon, Lady Ulrica and Mrs. Greatorex followed him with
an effect of yielding to a sudden impulse, and Emma found
herself alone on the lawn with Robert Fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if they&#8217;re all going,&#8221; she said with a little hysterical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
laugh, &#8220;I suppose we may as well go, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Yes. Do you think we ought?&#8221; Fell replied
in a strangely agitated voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison turned to look at him with a little start of
surprise. &#8220;Surely you&#8217;re not afraid?&#8221; she asked, unconsciously
revealing the cause of her own reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221; he echoed, entirely misunderstanding her true
intention. &#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;ghosts!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t really imagine, Mrs. Harrison....&#8221; Fell
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for one moment,&#8221; she said with determination. She
was disturbed and a trifle shocked by the marks of his agitation,
which had nevertheless stiffened her own courage. She was
prepared now to demonstrate how little she cared for an unexpected
coldness in the air, or for white figures moving about
at the most unlikely hours on the borders of the lake.</p>

<p>Already the shadows of the other five were stringing out
across the meadow, all of them clearly visible in the milky light
of the thinly veiled moon. They were moving very deliberately;
but a certain deliberation of approach was only decent
if they expected to disturb a tryst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, aren&#8217;t you coming, Mr. Fell?&#8221; Emma asked sharply.</p>

<p>He sighed and then, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; he said, in the tone
of one who finally commits himself.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreakleft">PART 2: THE APPEARANCE</h3></div>

<h4>1</h4>

<p>Harrison and Fell were within a few yards of the plantation,
when the vague pillar of illusive whiteness that flitted in
the shadow of the trees moved towards them, and, after the
slight hesitation of one who dreads to plunge, stepped into the
moonlight. But having thus dared the shock of immersion, it
seemed that for the moment her strength could carry her no
further. She stood motionless and with an effect of strained effort,
on the shadow, her eyes downcast and her crossed hands
grasping the ends of the tulle scarf that draped her head and
shoulders.</p>

<p>In that stiff pose, with the rigid lines of her figure delivered
milk-white against the sullen background of the yews, she
looked less like a human being than the rather conventional
image of some idealised virgin, the expression of a dream,
modelled none too definitely in wax by an artist whose recollection
of his vision was already fading.</p>

<p>Harrison stopped short and laid his hand on Fell&#8217;s arm.
&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; he asked him. It was manifestly an absurd question
to put to his companion, a stranger in Long Orton; but
in the first agitation of the discovery Harrison clutched at the
nearest support.</p>

<p>&#8220;No idea!&#8221; Fell replied. He was suddenly disappointed and
downcast. This girl, whoever she might be, was certainly not
Phyllis, and all the furious expectations and fine resolves that had
wonderfully lighted him had been quenched with an abruptness
that left him listless and momentarily devoid of curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; repeated Greatorex, who had been only a
pace or two behind them. He spoke in the tone a man might
use while surreptitiously addressing his neighbour during a
church-service. This echo of his own question seemed to annoy
Harrison. He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and
turning round addressed his wife in a voice that was unnecessarily
strident.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a mysterious lady come to call upon us, Emma,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Harrison, giggling nervously, put the essential
but manifestly hopeless question for the third time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; she asked, in an undertone.</p>

<p>Harrison may have hoped that the shock of his voice, and,
perhaps, of his determinedly sceptical attitude, would have exorcised
the phantom that was assuredly, so he had already decided,
the creation of a moment&#8217;s excited imagination. But
when he turned back to face the plantation, the pale figure still
stood in the same attitude, and seemed now, moreover, to have
attained a sharper definition of outline; to be altogether more
human and solid.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, you know, it <i>is</i> someone, after all,&#8221; Harrison
murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it <i>is</i> someone, right enough,&#8221; Fell said, at present
concerned only with the fact that it was not the right someone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Well!&#8221; Harrison softly ejaculated, as one who braces
himself to an encounter.</p>

<p>He stepped forward a couple of paces with a slightly grotesque
air of greeting. &#8220;Hm! hm! I don&#8217;t quite know ...&#8221;
he said; &#8220;that is, might I ask whom we have the pleasure of&mdash;of
meeting so unexpectedly?&#8221;</p>

<p>The frozen intensity of the silence that appeared to follow
his question may have been due to the fact that each member
of the party was holding his or her breath in the expectation
of the moment.</p>

<p>The figure moved. Slowly and with an almost painful deliberation
she released the ends of the tulle scarf that was about
her head and shoulders, and let her hands fall to her sides. Her
mouth opened, but she did not speak; and after what might
have been another effort to reply&mdash;a just perceptible movement
of the head&mdash;she took a careful step backward, entering again
the shadow of the yews.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I say, you know....&#8221; Harrison began.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>She interrupted him with a gesture, raising her hand and
pointing with an unmistakable certainty at Lady Ulrica. And
the hand and forearm that by this gesture she once more plunged
into the moonlight had something the appearance of opalescent
glass.</p>

<p>Harrison, standing with his back to the house-party, did
not understand this indication and turned his head to see who
or what had been selected for peculiar notice; but Lady Ulrica
responded with a fine dignity. She came forward past Harrison
right up to the edge of the yews, and said in a voice that did
credit to her breeding:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, what is it? Can I help you in any way?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, no doubt to the infinite relief of the Harrisons,
the unknown replied. She had a little husky voice when she
first spoke, a voice that suggested the last sleepy clutter of roosting
birds; and her speech came with an appearance of effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently,&#8221; she said rather indistinctly, and added something
that sounded like &#8220;more strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Ulrica was painfully short-sighted. She had those
large, protuberant brown eyes, almost devoid of expression,
that are sometimes indicative of heart trouble. And as she answered,
she was fumbling at her breast for the impressive,
handled lorgnette that was discovered later on the coffee table
under the cedar.</p>

<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t quite sure, you know,&#8221; she said in her authoritative
contralto; &#8220;whether you were an apparition or not,
and so we came to see. But, of course, now we have seen you
and heard you speak, we shall be delighted to help you if you
want help, or&mdash;if you&#8217;d prefer it&mdash;to go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay near me,&#8221; the stranger said in a clearer voice, and
striking a lower pitch than when she had spoken first. &#8220;Till I
get more strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of the party had paused in a little knot, some six
or seven feet away, while this brief conversation had gone forward,
listening staring with an absorption that in other circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
might have been judged as slightly lacking in good
taste. But now, some kind of realisation of their attitude seemed
to come to them, and they diverted their attention by a manifest
effort from the two people on the edge of the plantation
and began to talk in low voices among themselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison, moving across to her husband, looked at
him with raised eyebrows, silently asking the obvious question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fraud,&#8221; he said in a careful undertone, and added rather
more viciously, &#8220;Hoax of some kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison, however, was not to be rebuffed so easily.
&#8220;But, Charles,&#8221; she said with a slight urgency, as if she would
persuade him to be reasonable; &#8220;don&#8217;t you think there is something
very <i>odd</i> about her? As if she were not quite sane? That
pose of the Virgin Mary when she was in the moonlight as
we came up? And did you notice that she&#8217;s wearing quite the
commonest sort of tulle scarf?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d noticed that,&#8221; he began, and then their attention
was snatched back to their strange visitor by the sound of a
laugh. It was a clear, high laugh, but just too near the edge of
emotion for a person under suspicion of madness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see to this,&#8221; Harrison murmured to his wife, and
took a few steps towards Lady Ulrica and the mysterious visitor.
He was a connoisseur of feminine beauty, and he had been
struck by what he mentally termed the &#8220;exquisite accuracy&#8221;
of the profile presented to him. It had come clear and sharp
against the background of the plantation, white and vivid in
the moonlight; a forehead in a vertical line over the delicately
rounded chin, a perfectly curved aquiline nose and the suggestion
of a fine, sensitive mouth. Harrison saw it as the considered
and patient modelling of some idealised profile in a cameo. It
was a type that he very greatly admired; and this sight of her
beauty perhaps softened the asperity of the cross-examination
he had intended.</p>

<p>He came within a few feet of her as he began to speak,
but she was still within the black shadow of the trees and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
could no longer distinguish her features.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we are rather at a loss, my dear young lady,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You understand, I hope, that if you find yourself in any
perplexity, my wife will be delighted to offer you our hospitality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of answering him she put out her hand towards
Lady Ulrica, but when that lady made a responsive movement,
the stranger shrank away again.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t help me,&#8221; she murmured. An undercurrent
of agitation was coming into her speech, and began to dominate
it as she continued, more hurriedly; &#8220;I can&#8217;t help it, if
they won&#8217;t believe me. They&#8217;re antag&mdash;antago&mdash;tell them to
be still&mdash;in their thoughts&mdash;in their....&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice died out, fluttering down through the original
quality of huskiness that had first distinguished it, to a hoarse,
diminishing whisper. And it seemed at the same moment as if
she also were stealthily retreating, sliding away from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! She&#8217;s going!&#8221; Harrison cried out. &#8220;We mustn&#8217;t
let her get away like this. She&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s not safe to be left alone.
We must catch her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But already the stranger was nearly out of sight. For an
instant they saw her through the darkness, as an illusive pillar
of faint light gleaming among the profound shadows of the
yews; a pale uncertain form that vanished even as they started
in pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get to the bottom of this,&#8221; Harrison announced
with determination as he led the search.</p>

<p>Yet, from the very outset, that search was the most perfunctory
and futile affair. The members of the party, two of
whom stayed behind, exhibited a marked inclination not to
separate. Outside, in the security of the moonlight and each
other&#8217;s society, they had suffered mystification, wonder, perhaps
an occasional thrill of apprehension, but not that peculiar quality
of fear that lay in wait for them the moment they entered
the gloom of the plantation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>Even Greatorex felt that influence. He had followed his
host, in advance of the other three, but lost sight of him directly as
he entered the cover of the trees. He started violently when a
twig brushed his face, and then, with a just perceptible note
of alarm in his voice, called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, Harrison! You there? It&#8217;s so infernally dark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison answered him with a remarkable promptitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, G.!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That you? I&#8217;m close here! I&#8217;ll wait
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were as a matter of fact separated only by the spread
of a single yew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see that we stand much chance of catching the
lady in a place like this, Harrison,&#8221; Greatorex remarked when
they had joined company. &#8220;You might hide a platoon under
these trees in this light, what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a narrow belt of it,&#8221; Harrison replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
through on to the shore of the lake in ten yards. We can see
her then for half a mile if she&#8217;s come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Greatorex agreed, and added in a mood of
sudden confidence; &#8220;Beastly weird sort of place, this, but it&#8217;s
been a weird sort of affair altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad woman,&#8221; commented Harrison with a touch of vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer, certainly,&#8221; Greatorex agreed. &#8220;But why did you
say hoax, just now? You don&#8217;t think that...?&#8221;</p>

<p>They had been talking in interrupted snatches as they
pressed their way, keeping close together, through the stubborn
resistance of the yews, but as Greatorex&#8217;s sentence trailed away
with a suggestion of cutting off his own suspicions, they came
out on to the long grass that bordered the lake.</p>

<p>Harrison stopped, and gave a sigh that may have indicated
his relief at getting clear from the intriguing opposition of the
plantation.</p>

<p>Before them was spread the placid deep of the black water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
so calm and rigid that it looked like a sheet of unsoiled and
faintly lustrous ice. To the right and left of them the bank ran
in a flat curve, in full sight for a quarter of a mile each way,
save that it was bordered by an uneven selvage of impenetrable
black shadow. But nowhere was there any sign of a flitting
white shape, escaping from the charges of hoax or insanity
that had been brought against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either got away or hiding in the plantation,&#8221; remarked
Greatorex, after a pause during which with a suggestion of
breathless eagerness the two men had searched the moonlit distances.
The wreath of cirrus had cleared away now, and the
moon had reached the perfect gold of its ultimate splendour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; Harrison replied thoughtfully. &#8220;Not much good
searching the plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might as well hunt for a louse in a woodstack,&#8221; Greatorex
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you make of it, G.?&#8221; Harrison asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty queer business altogether,&#8221; Greatorex replied.
And then with a sudden drop in his voice, he added on a note
of alarm, &#8220;What the devil is that you&#8217;ve got on your back,
Harrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? What? What d&#8217;you mean?&#8221; Harrison asked nervously.</p>

<p>Greatorex took a step towards him, and after a moment&#8217;s
pause in which he hesitated as if afraid to touch some uncanny
thing, laid hold of a long wisp of drapery and stripped it from
his host&#8217;s back and shoulders. It seemed to Greatorex that the
flimsy thing clung slightly to the smooth cloth of the dinner
jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? What is it?&#8221; asked Harrison impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like that scarf the apparition was wearing,&#8221; Greatorex
remarked, displaying it.</p>

<p>Harrison clutched at it eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, so it is!&#8221; he said; &#8220;tangible proof, this, G., of
the lady&#8217;s substantiality. Good, solid evidence of fact. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
must all have seen it. Emma even mentioned it to me as being
of rather common material.&#8221; As he spoke he was fingering the
stuff of the scarf; running it through his hands, as if he found
an almost sensual pleasure in the reassuring quality of its undoubted
substance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; Greatorex answered, little less relieved
than his companion; but anxious, now, to prove that he had
never for one instant been under any delusion as to the nature
of the apparition. &#8220;You never thought, did you, that the lady
was a ghost?&#8221; His laugh as he asked the question had a slightly
insincere ring, but Harrison was too preoccupied with his own
thoughts to notice that.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ghost! My dear G.!&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ghost of what, in
Heaven&#8217;s name? No, no, she was solid enough. But what&#8217;s
puzzling me is whether she was insane, or whether, as seems
to me more probable, the whole thing was a hoax of some kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suggest that Vernon, or Lady Ulrica....&#8221;
Greatorex began, but Harrison cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They would not be so silly.
It was just a coincidence that we should have been discussing
all this foolishness beforehand. No, there are thousands of deluded
idiots about, of one sort or another, who have gone mad
on this spiritualism business, and I think the most probable explanation
is that some week-end visitor at the hotel&mdash;we&#8217;ve
got quite a decent hotel in the village, you know, kept by a
fellow called Messenger&mdash;some woman or other, a little cracked
on this subject, came out here and was tempted to try a little
experiment on us. Probably she didn&#8217;t mean to go quite so far,
in the first instance. Just showed herself in the moonlight,
playing at being an apparition for our benefit. She&#8217;d be able
to see us on the lawn from here. And then when we caught
her, she had to play up to the part. No doubt, she recognised
Lady Ulrica&#8217;s credulity. Recognised her as the kind of woman
that makes the fortune of the ordinary medium. And all that
nonsensical talk of hers&mdash;not badly done, in a way, by the by&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
just the sort of stuff they spew up at a sance. Eh? Don&#8217;t
you agree? What we&#8217;ve got to do now is to find out who it
was. We&#8217;ll go down and talk to Messenger tomorrow morning,
and get the truth about it. He&#8217;s got an uncommonly pretty
daughter, by the way; and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll take Fell. He
showed signs of being a trifle pris in that quarter, when he
was down here last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison&#8217;s confidence grew as he spoke, and before he had
finished he had warmed to quite a glow of certainty. His excitement
had something the quality of that displayed by one
who finds himself unhurt after a nasty accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Expect you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Greatorex agreed calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;d better get back to the others&mdash;with our&mdash;our
evidence.&#8221; Harrison looked down at the scarf in his hands,
and began automatically to fold it as he spoke. &#8220;There&#8217;s a path
through the plantation, a few yards further up,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;No need for us to tear ourselves to pieces among the shrubs.
As you said, we haven&#8217;t the least chance of finding the lady
by this light, and the only decent thing we can do is to clear
off, and let her find her way back to the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your theory is the right one,&#8221; Greatorex commented,
as they began to walk up the bank of the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a better?&#8221; snapped Harrison.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no,&#8221; Greatorex admitted. &#8220;Can&#8217;t say I have. And
anyway, yours is susceptible of proof. All we have to do is to
find the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; Harrison said without conviction. He foresaw,
with a little qualm of uneasiness, that his failure to produce
the lady might prove a difficulty in any controversy that might
follow with Vernon and Lady Ulrica. If he definitely committed
himself to a theory that could be upheld or discredited
by the investigation of verifiable facts, he would be at an immense
disadvantage should the facts go against him&mdash;as, he
was ready to admit to himself, they very possibly might. He
realised that in his excitement he had been too hasty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>&#8220;Of course, G.,&#8221; he said on a faintly expostulating note,
&#8220;of course, I may have been rather premature in assuming that
this&mdash;er&mdash;visitor of ours was staying at the hotel. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t
in any way insist on that. It&#8217;s our first chance and perhaps our
best one; but there are other alternatives. We can begin with
this scarf. That&#8217;s our solid ground of evidence. What we have
to do is to trace the owner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; Greatorex agreed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Harrison noticed the sound of a qualification in his friend&#8217;s
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, oh yes; that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Greatorex agreed. &#8220;I was
only wondering why, after all, we should bother any more
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison was too clever a man to attempt evasions. He saw
quite clearly that if he pretended some more or less plausible
excuse such as being annoyed by the trespass, Greatorex would
see through him. And he would not risk that. Instead, he took
what seemed a perfectly safe line.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be quite honest, G.,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am fully anticipating
that Vernon will claim this&mdash;this experience, as being a spiritualistic
phenomenon. And&mdash;and&mdash;well, I&#8217;ll admit that that
attitude annoys me. It&#8217;s so childish. This seems to me a&mdash;a
perfectly fair instance of the sort of thing that these credulous
people take hold of and transform into what they call proof.
Properly garbled, as no doubt it will be, this silly little incident
will presently be figuring in the Proceedings of the S.P.R. as
&#8216;new evidence.&#8217; Vernon could dress it up to look as circumstantial
as the evidence in a police-court&mdash;give all our names
and addresses, and make out affidavits for us to sign&mdash;affidavits
that would not contain a single mis-statement of fact so far as
we can see, but taken altogether would have an entirely false
significance. You know how the....&#8221; He broke off suddenly
in the middle of his sentence. &#8220;What the devil&#8217;s that?&#8221; he
asked sharply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>He had paused in his walk, as was his habit when he wished
to elaborate an argument, and they had not yet left the bank
of the lake for the path through the plantation. What had so
abruptly diverted his attention was the beginning of a sound
in that airless night, a sound that, as they waited and listened,
waxed from the first insistent whispering with which it had
begun, to a fierce rustling that seemed to swell almost to a roar,
before it died again to the hushed sibilance of the outset.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil is it?&#8221; Greatorex muttered.</p>

<p>Harrison gave a little scream of half-hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our&mdash;our nerves must have been very thoroughly upset,
G.,&#8221; he said in a strained voice, &#8220;if&mdash;if you and I can be startled
by the sound of wind in the poplars. They&#8217;re on the island
there, a big clump of them. Now I think of it, that&#8217;s one of
the things that made this place so confoundedly unfamiliar to-night.
It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever been here when it has been
so still that the poplars weren&#8217;t talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wind!&#8221; ejaculated Greatorex. &#8220;There is no wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been,&#8221; Harrison said, and pointed to the lake
whose level surface was now flawed here and there by a tiny
ripple that flashed an occasional reflected sparkle from the high
moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer!&#8221; Greatorex ejaculated, and shivered as if he were
suddenly cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, after all, why queer, G.,?&#8221; Harrison expostulated,
although there was still a note of uneasiness in his voice. &#8220;I&mdash;I
mean, there are always, on the stillest night, these slight
movements of the air. We happen to notice it because it&#8217;s so
particularly still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncannily still,&#8221; Greatorex murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! damn it, G.,&#8221; Harrison expostulated; &#8220;if you&#8217;re going
to get superstitious about meteorological conditions....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use pretending, Harrison,&#8221; Greatorex returned.
&#8220;There <i>is</i> something uncanny about this place to-night. I&#8217;m
not a superstitious man, as you know, but I don&#8217;t mind confessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that I&#8217;ve got the creeps.&#8221; He shivered again, and then
added, &#8220;Come along, let&#8217;s get back to your familiar house. I&#8217;ve
had enough of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison&#8217;s only reply at the moment was a grunt of annoyance,
but after they had turned into the path between the yews
he began to talk again. &#8220;Admitting,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that my nerves,
too, are a trifle on edge, what does that prove, unless it is that
we still retain something of the emotional fear of the savage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a chap you are for proving things this evening,&#8221;
Greatorex returned. &#8220;That argument with Vernon has upset
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They lay such stress on all these subjective reactions,&#8221;
Harrison grumbled, evidently continuing his own line of
thought. &#8220;A normal psychology....&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point they came out of the plantation into the
clear spaces of the meadow and were instantly hailed by Fell
and Mrs. Greatorex, who came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The others have gone on,&#8221; Fell explained. &#8220;Lady Ulrica
had a kind of faint, and Mrs. Harrison and Vernon have taken
her back to the house. What a time you&#8217;ve been!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you didn&#8217;t find anyone?&#8221; Mrs. Greatorex asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, we didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Harrison replied. &#8220;Only a part of
the lady&#8217;s apparel.&#8221; And he exhibited the tulle scarf with the
air of one prepared to explain a conjuring trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221; Fell asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Harrison&#8217;s back,&#8221; Greatorex said.</p>

<p>&#8220;On his back?&#8221; ejaculated Fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simple enough, simple enough,&#8221; Harrison explained.
&#8220;We&#8217;d been dodging and skirmishing about the plantation,
and, no doubt, I unknowingly scraped the thing off one of the
trees. Greatorex saw it when we came out into the light by
the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Greatorex commented, &#8220;and it was spread out over
his coat as neatly as you please&mdash;might have been arranged
there as a kind of joke.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;Herbert!&#8221; his wife ejaculated. &#8220;Do you mean that the
woman was playing tricks on you; behind your back, as it
were?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison clicked his tongue, as if he were facetiously reproving
a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you too, Mrs. Greatorex,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&mdash;I give you
credit for more sense. The truth is that your good husband has
brought with him into this life some of the old fears and superstitions
that used to rule him when he plundered and murdered
on the high seas. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;in effect that&#8217;s the truth, though
we may find a biological explanation for the phenomenon without
accepting any theory of reincarnation. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a case of
latent cell memory, and to-night it has come out very&mdash;very
strongly. He can find no explanation but the supernatural. I&mdash;I
assure you, when a little bit of a breeze sprang up just now
and set the poplars whispering, he was absolutely terrified. It
only needed another touch to set him crossing himself and
calling on his patron saint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Herbert!&#8221; Mrs. Greatorex expostulated. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
really believe it was a spirit, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone knew that Greatorex had married beneath him,
but his wife&#8217;s usual method in company was to maintain a
thoughtful silence that covered a multitude of faults. That
method was one of her own devising. Her husband had never
attempted to correct her. Nor did he now show the least impatience
either with her unusual loquacity or her failure to appreciate
Harrison&#8217;s persiflage.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear, as a matter of fact, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
if you ask me, our host is almost painfully anxious to prove that
the strange lady was of like substance to ourselves, of very flesh
and bone subsisting; I forget just how the quotation goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course she was,&#8221; his wife replied with an air of
assurance. &#8220;What else could she be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;er&mdash;by the way, Mrs. Greatorex,&#8221; Harrison put
in. &#8220;Did you&mdash;er&mdash;see her plainly? Could you by any chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
describe her for&mdash;for the purposes of identification?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I could,&#8221; Mrs. Greatorex said cheerfully.
&#8220;She was wearing a rather dowdy&mdash;old-fashioned, at least&mdash;white
dress, more like a nglige than anything. I thought it
funny she should come out in the garden in a thing like that.
But I didn&#8217;t make out quite what the material was. It looked
like a rather fine linen tulle worn over a white linen petticoat,
I thought. And she had a common scarf&mdash;but of course you&#8217;ve
got that in your hand now....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! yes,&#8221; Harrison interrupted. &#8220;But her face, eh? Did
you happen to catch her in profile, by any chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I <i>did</i> notice her face very particularly,&#8221;
Mrs. Greatorex said. &#8220;She seemed quite an ordinary sort of
young woman, I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had been retracing their way across the field as they
talked, and now having reached the sunk fence, filed up the
little flight of stone steps to the garden. Before them, across
the width of the lawn the lighted windows of the drawing-room
shone artificially yellow against the whiteness of the
moonlight. They had returned to the influences of their own
world; even the garden planned and formalised was a man-made
thing. But as they crossed the short, well-kept turf, some
common impulse made them pause, and with a movement that
seemed to be concerted, turn back to look down over the meadow
to the plantation and the solemn stretches of the lake&mdash;back
to that other world, vague, mysterious and enormously
still, into which they had so carelessly penetrated.</p>

<p>No one spoke until Harrison, with an impatient sigh, remarked
suddenly: &#8220;Oh, come along! let&#8217;s get back to sanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! Yes,&#8221; Greatorex agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;About time we went to bed,&#8221; Harrison went on. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
be wiser in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Fell began as they resumed their walk to the
house, but Harrison cut short his speculations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Emma coming to reprove us,&#8221; he interrupted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
&#8220;She&#8217;ll probably insist on our all taking something hot to ward
off the evil effects of miasma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison was, in fact, coming quickly to meet them
with a brisk air of urgency, and as though she would shorten
the little distance that still divided them, she called to her husband
while she was still some few yards away, on a note that
held the suggestion of a faint asperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles. I want to speak to you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we in the way?&#8221; Fell asked as they hurried to meet
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison looked at him for a moment as if she had
been unexpectedly reminded of the fact of his existence, and
then, taking no notice of his question, continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;That man Messenger, from the hotel, is here, Charles,
with the police sergeant. They want to see you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison&#8217;s quick mind leapt at once to a possible explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Now we shall hear something about the lady of the
lake, no doubt,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Messenger&#8217;s daughter,&#8221; Mrs. Harrison replied.
&#8220;She&#8217;s&mdash;she has disappeared. They are looking for her; and
Messenger wants to know if they can go down to the plantation.
He has apparently got some idea that she may be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; commented Harrison on a falling note, and exchanged
a glance of understanding with his wife. Then they
both turned and looked at Fell.</p>

<p>He had almost forgotten the resolutions he had made an
hour earlier, and was quite unprepared to meet the silent accusation
that was now levelled at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and hear what Messenger
and the Sergeant have to tell us. I suppose this means
that we shall have to make another pilgrimage to the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatorex, in the rear of the procession, was heard to remark
that he was damned if he could make head or tail of it.</p>




<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreakleft">PART 3: THE EXPLANATION</h3></div>

<h4>1</h4>

<p>Mr. Messenger and the Sergeant were in the drawing-room
talking to Lady Ulrica and Vernon, when Harrison, at
the head of the little party, entered by the French window.</p>

<p>Mr. Messenger&#8217;s story was soon told. His daughter had
left the hotel presumably between nine and ten o&#8217;clock, and
had not been seen since. He explained that he was peculiarly
anxious because she had been in very low spirits recently. For
one thing, a friend of hers, a Mrs. Burton who lived a few
miles away, had committed suicide about three weeks before.
Also, and here Mr. Messenger looked rather pointedly in the
direction of Robert Fell; also, he believed that she had&mdash;he
paused with obvious intention before he concluded&mdash;&#8220;she had&mdash;another
trouble on her mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison had listened with a preoccupied air that was unusual
to him. But as the hotel-keeper finished his story, he
warmed again to his usual alertness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you, Messenger,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we have only
this moment come up from the lake, all of us. And we saw no
sign of your daughter there, but we did meet another young
woman, a perfect stranger to all of us, who behaved in&mdash;er&mdash;in
a rather odd manner. Might I ask you if you have anyone
staying with you who at all answers that description?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve no one staying in the house at all this week-end,
sir,&#8221; Messenger replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you know of anyone, any stranger staying in the
village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one, sir, to my knowledge,&#8221; Messenger said,
and went on quickly: &#8220;But have I your permission now, sir,
for me and Mr. Stevens to go down to the plantation, and&mdash;and
the lake?&#8221; He paused before he added in a lower tone,
&#8220;Though I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll be too late. She&#8217;s been gone, now,
for more than three hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve just come back from the plantation, all of us,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Harrison protested. &#8220;If she&#8217;d been there, surely we should
have seen her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if she&#8217;d ... if she&#8217;d been....&#8221; Messenger began,
and stopped abruptly, putting his hand to his throat as if his
words had choked him.</p>

<p>Stevens, the police-sergeant, shifted his feet uneasily and
looked half-appealingly at Mrs. Harrison. &#8220;Mr. Messenger is
afraid as Miss Phyllis may &#8217;ave&mdash;may &#8217;ave done what her friend
Mrs. Burton did,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison got to her feet with a sudden effect of tense
emotion, but before she could speak her husband cut in quickly
by saying, &#8220;We&#8217;d better have the electric torches, Emma.
Will you get them? G. and I will go, too. Will you come,
Vernon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Vernon said. There was a light in his eyes
that was hardly indicative of horror or even of pity.</p>

<p>Harrison turned away from him with a movement of disgust.
&#8220;And Fell? Where&#8217;s Fell?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>But Fell had already left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went out by the window, a couple of minutes back,
sir,&#8221; the Sergeant said.</p>

<p>Charles Harrison was at all times an impatient man, and
there were occasions, as in the present case, when his nervous
irritability completely overcame him. He was seriously distressed
by the thought that Phyllis Messenger had in all probability
committed suicide. That touched him on his human,
generous side. But the thing that had finally upset him had
been the look on Vernon&#8217;s face; rapt, faintly mystical, the look
of one who believed that a very miracle had been performed
for his benefit. Harrison could not endure to remain in his
presence for another moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll go on and see what&#8217;s become of Fell,&#8221; he mumbled
as he fairly scuttled out of the room.</p>

<p>Once outside, he began to run. He wanted to think, but
his mind was full of exasperation&mdash;with Vernon for his look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of triumph, with the unfortunate Phyllis Messenger, with the
vacillating Robert Fell as the immediate cause of the whole
disaster. It seemed to Charles Harrison as if a fortuitous coincidence
of events were conspiring against him to produce the
illusion of a spiritualistic phenomenon. He did not believe for
one moment that the stranger he had seen by the plantation
was the spirit of the drowned Phyllis Messenger, but he foresaw
the kind of case that Vernon would make out, and the effect
it would have upon all the other members of the party.
He could not even be sure that his own wife might not be
influenced. When that confounded Stevens had hinted at the
probability of this girl&#8217;s suicide, a very queer expression had
come into Emma&#8217;s face, just as if she had suddenly realised
some strange, significant connection between the possibility
of the girl&#8217;s death and that other experience earlier in the evening.
He had cut hurriedly into the conversation for fear that
she might say something foolish....</p>

<p>No, no, the girl could not, must not be dead. They would
find her somewhere. And yet, so great was Harrison&#8217;s foreboding
that he never paused a moment by the yews, but hurried
straight on to the shore of the lake. He had seen nothing of
Fell. He had indeed forgotten all about him.</p>

<p>The night was still clear, but it was no longer frozen into
that rigid immobility which had earlier produced so strange an
effect of expectancy. There was a perceptible movement of
air from the west, the familiar voices of the poplars maintained
a perpetual background of sound, and when he had come
through the plantation to the edge of the lake, he could hear
the minute clashing of the reeds as the chasing ripple of the
water set them gently swaying. The air of mystery had fled.
He no longer felt the least influence of fear. The dread that
he might presently see something that heavily floated, rocking
and pressing against the rushes, was more the dread of annoyance.</p>

<p>But there was no one in sight. Nothing moved on all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
long curving reaches of the bank. There was no sound in the
night other than the faint crash of the reeds, the soft chuckle
of the water and the steady insistence of the sibilant poplars.</p>

<p>And search as he would up and down the brooding sweep
of the dark water, damascened here and there by the yellow
silver of moonlight reflected from the crest of the increasing
ripple, he could see no slender raft of floating drapery, nor any
sign of a sodden form, nearly immersed, sagging inertly towards
the bank.</p>

<p>He desisted presently, and sat down to consider the whole
situation. The sense of exasperation had faded under the influence
of the night&#8217;s peace, and he fell into a calmer consideration
of the problem that was vexing him. He saw that he
must take the initiative, state his case before Vernon could get
a word in. He would treat the affair as an instance of the kind
of thing that gets worked up into what these people absurdly
called &#8220;evidence.&#8221; The coincidence of this stranger, (whoever
she was,) turning up on the very evening on which that
unhappy girl had drowned herself&mdash;if she had sunk, they
would have an awful job to recover the body; the lake was
over forty feet deep in places&mdash;was just another of those coincidences
that had probably been responsible for most of the
superstitions about the appearance of the spirit at the moment
of death. And in this case it was obviously absurd to argue that
it was the spirit of Phyllis Messenger they had seen. <i>And
heard!</i> That was a good point. Finally and conclusively, there
was the tulle scarf; real and solid enough. No one had ever
heard of a spirit leaving such material evidence behind it.
What had he done with that scarf, by the way? He had had
it in his hand when he had entered the drawing-room. He&#8217;d
probably laid it down there, somewhere. He must make enquiries
about that as soon as he got in. It might help him to
trace the identity of the stranger.</p>

<p>He had wandered a quarter of a mile or so away from the
path through the plantation, and he jumped up now, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
intention of getting back at once to the house, in order to make
sure of that valuable piece of evidence. But as he came out of
his preoccupation, his attention was arrested by the distant
murmur of little detached sounds, the separated notes of human
voices, musical in their remoteness, faintly impinging upon the
textured whisperings of the night.</p>

<p>They are still looking for that poor girl, he thought with
a twinge of remorse for his own loss of interest in the search.
But even as he started to join them, he realised that the sounds
were retreating, fading imperceptibly into the depths of the
night. Have they found her, I wonder, he murmured to himself,
thinking still of a desecrated and draggled body; and then
he heard himself being distantly hailed in the strong, cheerful
voice of his friend Greatorex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy there, Harrison; Harrison, ahoy!&#8221; he was shouting.</p>

<p>It was not in the least the voice one would expect from a
man who had so recently stood in the presence of the dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy! Hallo! Where are you?&#8221; Harrison shouted in
return.</p>

<p>The next minute he saw the tall, athletic figure of Greatorex
coming towards him along the bank of the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been looking for you everywhere,&#8221; Greatorex said as he
came within speaking distance. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alive?&#8221; gasped Harrison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather. Not exactly hearty, perhaps, but she&#8217;s all right.
Well enough, in any case, to walk back to the house in the
company of her father and Fell.&#8221; He dropped his voice confidentially
as he added: &#8220;Seems that it&#8217;s a case with Fell. What?
We found &#8217;em together, you know, in a cosy little place among
the yews, not five yards from the spot where the mysterious
lady came out. Perfect little tunnel up to it, too. If we&#8217;d happened
on it at first, we&#8217;d have found the girl there and saved
all the trouble. Fell knew all about the place, it seems. Went
straight to it and found Miss Messenger in a faint, or just recovering
from it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8220;How long had she been there?&#8221; Harrison asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the time, presumably,&#8221; Greatorex said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come there to meet Fell, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems probable. And we spoilt his little game by coming
too, I suppose. However, he&#8217;s owned up now. Made a clean
breast of it, and declared his intention of marrying her; in the
presence of five witnesses. Quite a dramatic little scene there
was. Old Messenger was almost overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison did not seem to have been attending to this speech,
for his next question was:</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t find anything else there, did you? No apparatus
of any kind, such as a mask or attempts at a disguise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, no. I didn&#8217;t see anything, and I was the first to get
to them,&#8221; Greatorex replied. &#8220;But why? You don&#8217;t think....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That she may have been prepared? I do,&#8221; Harrison said
emphatically. &#8220;She&#8217;d made an assignation and come ready to
pass herself off as someone else if she were caught&mdash;which she
very nearly was. Showed herself in the first instance in order
to attract Fell&#8217;s attention, and unfortunately for her brought
the whole party out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no, no, Harrison. No, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; Greatorex
said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got that blessed apparition or whatever it was
on your nerves. But, honestly, that explanation won&#8217;t do.
Why, the girl was half-unconscious when I found &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put on,&#8221; Harrison interpolated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; Greatorex replied. &#8220;When we got her out
into the open, she was still as white as a sheet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Effect of moonlight,&#8221; commented Harrison.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Greatorex&#8217;s tone had a quality of great assurance.
&#8220;No, she was recovering from a faint all right. There can be
no question of that. Besides, what could be the point of all that
make-believe after she was found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she may have fainted after she&#8217;d fooled us,&#8221; Harrison
suggested. &#8220;Overwrought, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had been making their way steadily back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
house as they talked, but Greatorex stopped now in the middle
of the meadow, and took Harrison by the lapel of his dinner-jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad line, my friend,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;Take my advice
and don&#8217;t attempt it before Vernon. I&#8217;m advising you for your
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, who the devil was it?&#8221; Harrison snapped impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! there you have me,&#8221; Greatorex said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, good God, G.,&#8221; Harrison expostulated. &#8220;<i>You</i> don&#8217;t
believe that it was a&mdash;er&mdash;an apparition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno what to think,&#8221; Greatorex said.</p>

<p>Harrison blew a deep breath of disgust. &#8220;I thought you
had more sense,&#8221; he snapped out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m willing to be convinced,&#8221; Greatorex replied;
&#8220;if you have any other explanation to offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Harrison had nothing further to say in the matter just
then. He wanted to see Phyllis Messenger first, alone. When
he had got his evidence, he would be ready to offer his explanation.</p>

<p>They found only Mrs. Harrison and Mrs. Greatorex in
the drawing-room when they entered by the French window.
Messenger, his daughter, Stevens and Fell had gone back to
the hotel, she explained, and Vernon and Lady Ulrica were in
the morning-room, conferring, so Mrs. Harrison suggested,
over the events of the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know whether Mr. Fell means to come
back,&#8221; Mrs. Harrison concluded with a lift of her eyebrows.
&#8220;He seemed&mdash;well, rather ashamed of himself altogether. I&#8217;m
not sure that he hasn&#8217;t taken his things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as well, perhaps,&#8221; her husband said. And then his
observant glance fell on the tulle scarf thrown over the back
of a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find out whom that belonged to?&#8221; he asked
sharply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Harrison. &#8220;They left it behind
after all. It&#8217;s Miss Messenger&#8217;s. She identified it at once and
wondered how it had got here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certain it was hers, I suppose?&#8221; Harrison asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes! It&#8217;s got her initials worked on it,&#8221; his wife told
him.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Harrison stood thoughtfully drawing
the scarf through his hands, then dropping it back on to the
chair, he said: &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, then. Hadn&#8217;t we better be going
to bed? It&#8217;s after one o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>When Charles Harrison set about the investigation of that
night&#8217;s mystery, he was still intent upon the theory that the
appearance he had seen and spoken to was in fact the living
personality of some stranger who had been staying either in the
village or possibly at Orton Park, the grounds of which sloped
down to the other side of the lake. There were a couple of
canoes and a punt in Lord Orton&#8217;s boathouse, and the crossing
presented no real difficulty. He was, however, finally deflected
from that theory in the course of his interview with Miss Messenger.</p>

<p>He had been quite firm at breakfast. As a result, no doubt,
of the &#8220;conference&#8221; they had held the night before, Lady Ulrica
and Vernon were eager to begin an immediate discussion of
what they called the &#8220;phenomenon.&#8221; Harrison effectively stopped
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no!! no!!!&#8221; he said, putting his hands over his ears
as soon as the topic was opened. &#8220;Now, Vernon, you profess
to be scientific in your investigations. You&mdash;you insisted on
that in your&mdash;er&mdash;lecture under the cedar last night. Now
listen to me. I promise to thrash this out with you&mdash;presently.
To&mdash;to discuss the thing in all its bearings. But I at least mean
to be thorough and careful in my methods. Give me to-day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
examine the case. I must cross-examine the principal witness&mdash;er&mdash;alone.
Yes. I insist on that. You&#8217;ll have the very best
intentions, of course. I don&#8217;t doubt it. But you&#8217;ll offer suggestions&mdash;unconsciously,
perhaps, but you&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; Vernon replied. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you put suggestions
into the examinee&#8217;s mind, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! hm! You&#8217;ll have to trust me,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;I
assure you that I only want to arrive at the truth of&mdash;of the
actual facts, you understand. I want to know what Miss Messenger
was doing down there for three hours or more. And if
you want me to discuss the thing with you, you must let me
get at the facts in my own way. I&mdash;I make that a condition.
If you won&#8217;t agree to it, I shall refuse to discuss the thing at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; Vernon agreed.</p>

<p>And Harrison had gone off to the hotel after breakfast, in
the cheerful state of mind of one who has good reasons to hope
for the best.</p>

<p>Miss Messenger received him in the private parlour of the
hotel, a room that evidenced her desperate efforts to alleviate
the influence of the original furniture.</p>

<p>She professed to be completely recovered from the effects
of her adventure, and indeed she displayed no sign of illness.
Her engagement to Robert Fell was, it seemed, an understood
thing, and she received Mr. Harrison&#8217;s congratulations with
the air proper to the occasion. Harrison, who had only known
her very slightly hitherto, decided in his own mind that she
was a very charming young woman, and came at last to the
purpose of his visit with a slight effect of apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know whether you have heard, Miss Messenger,&#8221;
he began, &#8220;that we had another visitor in the plantation
last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened her eyes at that, with a genuine surprise that
could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Mr. Fell or your father say anything to you about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it?&#8221; Harrison continued.</p>

<p>She looked at him with obvious perplexity. &#8220;About another
visitor?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;No, they haven&#8217;t told me anything.
I don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll explain in a moment,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;There are
just one or two little questions that I&#8217;d like to ask you first, if
you don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head with a sigh. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I suppose as a matter of fact you know all about it already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something,&#8221; Harrison agreed, shrewdly guessing at her
meaning. &#8220;So far as you and Mr. Fell are concerned at least.
But&mdash;well&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you in a moment why I want to know&mdash;could
you say what the time was when you got to the plantation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little before ten,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;I heard the stable
clock in Orton Park strike after I&#8217;d been there a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! hm! And what did you <i>do</i> exactly between ten o&#8217;clock
and&mdash;er&mdash;half-past twelve or so?&#8221; Harrison enquired.</p>

<p>Phyllis Messenger&#8217;s face glowed suddenly red. &#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; she said after a marked pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you go to sleep, for instance?&#8221; Harrison asked with
a friendly smile.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a sleep,&#8221; she said, and then
went on quickly: &#8220;Oh, you said you knew&mdash;something. Don&#8217;t
you know how&mdash;how unhappy I was?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison turned his head away and stared at the ferns
in the fireplace. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard something,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;About my friend Rhoda Burton?&#8221; Miss Messenger said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! yes. She&mdash;she committed suicide about a month ago,
I believe?&#8221; Harrison mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I meant to do that, too,&#8221; Phyllis Messenger burst
out with a sudden boldness. &#8220;In there, where they found me.
I meant to&mdash;to strangle myself with my tulle scarf. I tied it
round my neck and I meant to do it. And then I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Harrison prompted her gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and then I threw it down&mdash;the scarf, I mean&mdash;and
everything went black. I thought I was going to die. I went
down on my knees and tried to pray. I don&#8217;t remember anything
after that until&mdash;until they found me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison&#8217;s agile mind seized the significance of this evidence
in a flash. At one stroke it eliminated the probability of
that scarf having been worn by a stranger. If the scarf had lain
there by the side of the swooning Miss Messenger, no one but
a mad woman could have callously picked it up, worn it and
postured before a group of half a dozen people without making
the least mention of the helpless figure to whom it belonged.
For a moment he played with the thought of a madwoman,
but dismissed it. If there was a madwoman in Long Orton or
the neighbourhood, he would have heard of her.</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and chiefly for the sake of giving himself
more time, said, &#8220;You&#8217;re quite sure you had the scarf with
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course,&#8221; Miss Messenger replied. &#8220;I only bought
it last week;&#8221; and added with a shudder, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t ever want
to see it again.&#8221; There could be no question of the vividness
of the unhappy memories associated in her mind with that
particular article of apparel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t follow, however,&#8221; Harrison went on thoughtfully
after a perceptible pause, &#8220;that because you have no memory
of anything after you fainted, you never moved from
the spot where you were found?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Messenger shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say anything
about that, can I?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Harrison explained, &#8220;earlier in the evening,
it may have been about eleven or thereabouts, my friends and
I saw someone down by the plantation, and&mdash;and went down
to investigate. And there we met and spoke to&mdash;er&mdash;someone
who was unquestionably wearing your scarf&mdash;which she later
discarded. It was found later by myself, as a matter of fact.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;How very extraordinary!&#8221; was all Miss Messenger&#8217;s
comment. Her surprise and interest, however, were beyond
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inexplicable,&#8221; Harrison agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who <i>could</i> it have been?&#8221; Miss Messenger besought
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It could, so far as I can make out, only have been yourself&mdash;in
a trance,&#8221; Harrison replied. He instinctively disliked
the sound of that last word, but could find no other. People
who have &#8220;swooned&#8221; or fainted do not walk about in that condition.
&#8220;Er&mdash;you&#8217;ve never, I suppose&mdash;er&mdash;been in that state
of unconsciousness before?&#8221; he went on quickly, as if to obliterate
the effect of the too suggestive word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not actually,&#8221; Miss Messenger said, hesitated, and then
continued: &#8220;but I&#8217;ve&mdash;felt queer once or twice lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer?&#8221; Harrison prompted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if&mdash;as if I were going off like I did last night,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;Only lately, though. Only since my friend died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burton?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm. Very sad, very,&#8221; said Harrison, getting up, and then
he added: &#8220;It was very good of you to answer my questions,
and I think, now, that I am satisfied as to the identity of the
stranger. You must have walked in your trance last night,
Miss Messenger, and made your way back again to the place
where we found you, dropping your scarf on the way. You
must forgive us for not recognising you in the half-light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Messenger had no comment to make on that explanation.
It was evident that she was not in a position to deny his
statement, even if she had had the desire to do so....</p>

<p>And after that interview, Harrison began to see his way
quite clearly. When he left the hotel he visited the scene of last
night&#8217;s encounter in order to make a thorough examination of
the place itself, and especially of that curious little enceinte
among the yews where Miss Messenger had been found. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
thought it possible that he might discover fresh evidence.</p>

<p>No fresh evidence, however, rewarded his investigation.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>He was, nevertheless, in very good spirits at dinner that
night. The discussion had been postponed by common consent
until the evening, but he once or twice referred to it in the
course of the meal.</p>

<p>Greatorex, noting his host&#8217;s almost gleeful manner, asked
him if he had got new and conclusive evidence in the process
of his investigations, but Harrison refused to answer that.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have it out after dinner. Vernon
has got his case, and I have mine. We&#8217;ll argue, and then
put it to the vote. Do you agree, Vernon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vernon, no less confident than his antagonist, agreed willingly
enough, and later, when they were all gathered together
in the drawing-room, he agreed also to open the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all so clear to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I cannot see how there
can be two opinions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, fire away,&#8221; Harrison encouraged him.</p>

<p>Vernon leaned back in his chair, and clasped his hands behind
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I postulate to begin with,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we were all in
precisely the right, expectant, slightly inert condition necessary
to the production of phenomena. We were sitting in a circle,
and our conscious minds were completely occupied with the
subject of spiritualism. We were, in fact, according to the common
agreement about such things, in the state that best enables
us to assist any possible manifestations by&mdash;by giving out power.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief medium in the case was unquestionably the
unconscious person of Miss Messenger. She was in what I may
call an ideal trance for the purpose of manifestation. Also, by
an extraordinary chance, her body was secluded and in darkness.
If the conditions had been planned by experts they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hardly have been improved upon. After that our explanation
of the apparition and of the &#8216;direct voice&#8217; phenomena is largely
dependent upon precedents.</p>

<p>&#8220;With regard to the first, I claim that von Schrenck-Notsing&#8217;s
photographs taken in Paris and elsewhere in 1912 and
1913 have sufficiently demonstrated that in favourable conditions
and with a sensitive medium, a form of matter, not as yet
scientifically described, may be drawn from the body of the
medium and used by the external agency to build up representations
not only of the human form, but also of familiar
materials. I mention that in order that we may not be in any
way disturbed by the fact that the materialisation was dressed
in a gown of different colour from that worn by Miss Messenger.
That gown too was instantly woven out of the creative
flux.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, the only thing that was not so momentarily created
and re-absorbed was the tulle scarf. That must actually have
been taken from Miss Messenger&#8217;s unconscious body and handled
by the temporary form evolved out of the teleplasm. There
is good precedent for that, as I believe I said last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then, as Harrison did not immediately
reply, he added: &#8220;And if we are all agreed, after we
have finished our discussion this evening, I would like to have
separate written accounts from each of you as to your sight of
the phenomenon; those, backed by the evidence of Mr. Messenger,
his daughter and the police sergeant, ought, I think, to
establish one of the most remarkable and convincing cases ever
reported to the S.P.R.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, steady, Vernon,&#8221; Harrison put in. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say
that I&#8217;m absolutely convinced as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the alternative explanation?&#8221; Vernon asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That it was Miss Messenger herself whom we saw in a
state of trance,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;You see I concede you the
trance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear man,&#8221; Vernon expostulated, &#8220;the figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
we saw by the wood was not like Miss Messenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Harrison replied. &#8220;Very well, let&#8217;s analyse the differences
as observed by the various witnesses. You begin, Vernon.
Was there any difference in height?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None to speak of that I noticed,&#8221; Vernon admitted, &#8220;but
that woman had a distinctly more spiritual face than Miss Messenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; Harrison pressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We only saw her for a few moments, of course,&#8221; Vernon
said. &#8220;I must confess that at the moment I can&#8217;t think of any
other marked differences. It&mdash;it was another face and expression,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Emma,&#8221; said Harrison, looking at his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be absolutely sure that it wasn&#8217;t Miss Messenger,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;We were all in rather an excited state just
then, weren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the dress was a different colour,&#8221; put in Mrs. Greatorex.
&#8220;That first woman was in white. Miss Messenger had
a grey dress on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, you know,&#8221; her husband continued, &#8220;that Vernon
rather hit the mark when he said that the first girl had a
more spiritual face. That was what struck me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any comments, Lady Ulrica?&#8221; Harrison asked.</p>

<p>Lady Ulrica sighed. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; she said honestly, &#8220;that
for observations of that kind, you can&#8217;t count on me one way
or the other. I&#8217;d left my glasses under the cedar, and I&#8217;m as
blind as a bat without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrison smiled and shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Well, come,
what does it all amount to?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Is there any reason in
the world why we should resort to so far-fetched an explanation
as the supernatural? Let us consider the evidence as if we
were going to put it before a body of expert opinion. We were,
according to Vernon&#8217;s own admission, in an &#8216;expectant, slightly
inert condition.&#8217; We had been talking spiritualism for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
hour or more after dinner, in very exceptional conditions. I never
remember a stiller or an&mdash;er&mdash;more emotional night. When
we were all worked up by Vernon&#8217;s eloquence into a peculiar
state of anticipation, we saw a white figure down by the lake.
It was inevitable, in these circumstances, that we should approach
it in a state of emotion. And what did we find? We
found a young woman walking in trance. Well, that state had
very naturally altered her usual appearance, given her face a
more spiritual expression. No doubt, she was very pale. She
told me this morning that she had contemplated suicide just
before she fell into this trance, and I conceive it as being probable
that her highly disturbed mental condition had reacted
upon her physical appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let us consider what actually happened. Three observers,
Emma, Fell and myself, had seen Miss Messenger before
and failed in those circumstances to recognise her. Is that
a very remarkable failure when we give due weight to our own
excited anticipations, coupled with the fact that the girl was
in an altogether abnormal physical state? Furthermore we find
that four people fail later to recognise Miss Messenger as the
original of the supposed stranger. Of these four, one admits
that she cannot be trusted as an observer of the details, another
that she hardly noticed the stranger&#8217;s face. A third, Vernon,
cannot deny that he was the victim of a prepossession, that he
anticipated a spiritualistic phenomenon and he is not therefore
a reliable witness. The fourth is our friend Greatorex. Now,
G., I ask you in all seriousness whether you would be prepared
to swear on oath that the figure we saw for a few seconds in
the moonlight down by the yews could not have been Miss
Messenger in a state of trance. On your oath, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Harrison, no. I would not be prepared to swear that,&#8221;
Greatorex said. &#8220;In fact, I believe you&#8217;re right about the
whole affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the dress, Mr. Harrison,&#8221; Mrs. Greatorex put in.
&#8220;That woman by the wood was in white. Miss Messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was wearing a grey dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The effect of moonlight, my dear lady,&#8221; Harrison replied.
&#8220;Moonlight takes the colour out of everything.&#8221; As he spoke,
he got to his feet and took a turn up the room. As he had argued,
the conviction of the truth of his theory had been steadily
growing in his own mind. He wanted, now, to clinch the thing
once and for all, eliminate the last possibility of sending in a
report to the S. P. R., and lay the ghost for ever. But as he
reached the end of the room, his eye fell on the tulle scarf left
by Miss Messenger on the previous night, now neatly folded
by the housemaid and laid on a table by the window. And he
realised in an instant that the confounded thing was grey and
matched the colour of Miss Messenger&#8217;s dress. Why then had
that scarf also not appeared white in the moonlight? It meant
nothing; no doubt he might be able to evolve some explanation,
but at the present moment it might most vexatiously complicate
his case. Everyone, strangely enough, had recognised
that scarf. It was the one thing that had appeared to be unaltered
by the unusual conditions.</p>

<p>Harrison was intellectually honest, but the temptation to
suppress that piece of evidence was too strong for him. As he
turned, he was between the table and the rest of the party, and
he stretched his hand out behind him, and surreptitiously crammed
the scarf into the pocket of his dinner-jacket.</p>

<p>But his peroration was spoilt. The enthusiasm seemed to
have been suddenly drained out of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! hm! Well, in effect,&#8221; he said as he returned, &#8220;I submit
that there is no reason whatever to seek a supernatural
explanation of our experience last night. What do you all say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m quite convinced that it was Miss Messenger
we saw,&#8221; his wife replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very probably, I should say,&#8221; Greatorex agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly seems the most likely explanation,&#8221; Mrs.
Greatorex added.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Lady Ulrica?&#8221; Harrison asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&#8220;Well, of course, if you are all sure it was Miss Messenger,
I don&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s anything more to be said,&#8221; Lady
Ulrica replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of us except Vernon,&#8221; Harrison amended.</p>

<p>Vernon sighed and leaned back in his chair. &#8220;You&#8217;ve pretty
effectively diddled my report to the S.P.R., anyway,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If no one is prepared to swear that the person we first saw
was not Miss Messenger, I&#8217;ve got no evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still Fell, of course,&#8221; Harrison suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we can rely upon anything Mr. Fell might
say,&#8221; Mrs. Harrison put in. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he had a reason for
not <i>wanting</i> to recognise Miss Messenger just then. I don&#8217;t
think Mr. Fell has behaved at all nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll drop it, Harrison,&#8221; Vernon said with a touch
of magnanimity. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;ve convinced me, even
about last night&#8217;s experience, but you&#8217;ve got all the ordinary
probabilities on your side. It&#8217;s curious how difficult it is even
to <i>plan</i> a perfect test case.&#8221;</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>Harrison had triumphed. He ought to have been content.
But the truth is that he had satisfied everyone but himself.
&#8220;That confounded scarf,&#8221; as he began to think of it, bothered
and perplexed him. He stowed it away in a drawer when he
went to bed, but in the small hours of the morning he found
himself wide awake reconsidering all the evidence. It had come
to him with a perfectly detestable clearness that if Vernon&#8217;s
theory was a true one, that scarf was the single piece of common
earthly material that had been used in the presentation of
the phenomenon they had witnessed; and it was, at least, a
strangely significant fact that the scarf should be the one thing
they had all seen so clearly, the one thing the appearance of
which had not been influenced by their mental emotion or the
effect of moonlight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>The coincidence bothered him. He could not find an explanation.</p>

<p>It continued to bother him the next morning. It came
between him and his work. And after lunch he put the scarf
in his pocket and made it an excuse to call again on Miss Messenger.
There were, perhaps, one or two further points that
might be elucidated in conversation with her. She had taken,
he judged, almost as violent an antipathy to the thing as he
had himself. The sight of it might produce some kind of shock,
might just possibly revive some memory of what had happened
during her trance.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the hotel, Miss Messenger was in the
garden, and he was shown up into her private sitting-room to
await her. Still thoughtfully considering the best means to approach
the production of the scarf, he walked absent-mindedly
across the room and began to stare at the photographs on the
mantelpiece. And then, suddenly, he became aware of the
illusion that he was gazing at a background of dark yews,
against which was vividly posed the delicate profile of some
exquisite cameo. He blinked his eyes in amazement, and the
background changed to the commonplace detail reflected in
the mirror. But the face remained, the very profile he had seen
by the plantation, a face sensitive and full of sadness, staring
wistfully out as if at some unwelcome vision of the future.</p>

<p>Harrison shivered. It seemed to him as if a thin draught of
cold air were blowing past him. And then, for a moment, he
had a sense of immense distances and strange activities beyond
the knowledge of common life. He was aware of some old experience
newly recognised after long ages of forgetfulness; an
experience that came back to him elusive as the thought of a
recent dream. But while he struggled to place that fugitive
memory, the door behind him opened, and the dark curtain of
physical reality was suddenly interposed between him and his
vision.</p>

<p>He heard the voice of Miss Messenger speaking to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my friend, Rhoda Burton,&#8221; she was saying. &#8220;The
photograph was taken only a week before she died. She was
in great trouble even then, poor darling.&#8221;</p>
